Community response has been very encouraging, with a noticeable increase in program awareness and participation.\n\n\u2022 Volunteer mobilisation: Training sessions for the new volunteer cohort have been scheduled and materials finalised. This should ensure everyone is fully equipped before community outreach begins next month.\n\n\u2022 Strategic focus for the next 6 months:\n  \u2013 Expanding services to additional under-served neighbourhoods\n  \u2013 Securing supplementary funding (grant applications are currently in progress)\n  \u2013 Deepening collaboration with local health professionals so we can offer a more comprehensive service mix\n\nNext steps\n1. Finalise the funding submissions by the end of this month.\n2. Launch the first round of volunteer-led clinics in early July.\n3. Convene a joint review meeting in late August to evaluate impact metrics and adjust plans for Q4.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to schedule a call to discuss any aspect in more detail. Your insight has been invaluable in shaping the programme, and we want to be sure our direction continues to align with Helping Hands\u2019 goals.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\n",
