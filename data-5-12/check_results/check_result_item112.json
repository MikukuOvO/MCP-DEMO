  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nGreat to hear from you \u2013 I\u2019m glad you\u2019re digging into the orientation material. Below is a quick reference on the two areas you asked about. (I\u2019ve also linked the full Bank Procedures Overview document for deeper detail.)\n\n1) Handling Customer Inquiries\n-------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Verify identity \u2013 ask for at least two authenticators (e.g., government-issued ID + last four digits of the account number).  \n\u2022 Log the interaction in the CRM as soon as the customer is authenticated.  \n\u2022 Resolve what you can on the spot, following the script in Section 2 of the Procedures Overview.  \n\u2022 If the request is outside your authorization level or takes longer than 10 minutes, open an internal help-desk ticket and let the customer know we\u2019re working on it.\n\n2) Reporting Issues / Escalation Protocol\n-------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Standard issues: email the help desk at internal-help@trustwellbank.com and attach the CRM case number.  \n\u2022 Urgent or high-risk issues (system outage, suspected fraud, or compliance breach):  \n   \u2013 Call your branch manager immediately (contacts are in the Regional Managers list on SharePoint).  \n   \u2013 Then open the help-desk ticket so the incident is tracked.  \n\u2022 For after-hours critical incidents, follow the same steps but also phone the on-call manager (number is on the SharePoint home page).\n\nAdditional Resources\n-------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Bank Procedures Overview (Notion link): https://www.notion.so/Bank-Procedures-Overview-1f00dc8fa0db815f9384c17fcf273c72  \n\u2022 Regional Managers Contact List (SharePoint \u203a Contacts \u203a Regional-Managers).  \n\u2022 Quick Reference Cheat Sheet \u2013 I\u2019ve attached the latest PDF to this email.*\n\nLet me know if anything here is unclear or if you\u2019d like to walk through real-world scenarios together. I\u2019m happy to set up a brief call.\n\nBest regards,\nJane\n\n*If you don\u2019t see the attachment let me know; I can resend or share it via Teams.",
