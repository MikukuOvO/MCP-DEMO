Below is a concise update e-mail summarizing those requirements; just let me know the correct Vitality Partners e-mail address (or confirm I should use something like partnerships@vitalitypartners.com) and I can send it right away.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013 DRAFT E-MAIL \u2013\u2013\u2013\nSubject: Updated Requirements for HealthHub Integration\n\nHi [Vitality Team],\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I\u2019d like to share our refined requirements for the HealthHub integration so we can move forward together:\n\n\u2022 Seamless integration with our existing employee-wellness programs and SSO.  \n\u2022 Ability to track individual employee health goals (steps, sleep, nutrition, etc.) and surface personalized insights.  \n\u2022 Library of configurable wellness challenges (step challenges, mindfulness streaks, healthy-eating goals, etc.) with team-based leaderboards.  \n\u2022 Admin dashboard that lets HR view aggregate engagement/health metrics while maintaining individual privacy.  \n\u2022 Push-notification and e-mail nudges that can be tailored to our quarterly wellness campaigns.  \n\u2022 GDPR/CCPA compliance and SOC 2 certification (or equivalent) required.  \n\nPlease let me know if you need any clarification or additional detail.  Once we have alignment, we can lock the scope for the next project phase and begin technical planning.\n\nThanks, and looking forward to collaborating.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nLet me know the recipient address (and any edits), and I\u2019ll send it for you.",
