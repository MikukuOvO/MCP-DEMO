While it\u2019s early, HR believes wellness participation is a contributing factor.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next (May\u2013June)\n\u2022 Launching a 4-week \u201cSpring Step-Up\u201d challenge on 20 May \u2013 goal is 100 million collective steps.\n\u2022 Introducing two 15-minute guided mindfulness breaks that managers can slot into team calendars.\n\u2022 Circulating a short feedback survey in mid-June to gather ideas for Q3 programming.\n\nI\u2019ll keep tracking the data and will share a more detailed metrics dashboard after the step challenge concludes. Please let me know if you\u2019d like any additional information or if there are particular KPIs you\u2019d like highlighted in future reports.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\nEmployee Wellness Coordinator",
