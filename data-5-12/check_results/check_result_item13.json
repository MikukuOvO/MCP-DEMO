  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well today. As promised, I\u2019m sending over a short list of evidence-based wellness ideas that can help you feel more centered, especially during demanding work weeks.\n\n1. Mindfulness Meditation (5\u201310 min)\n   \u2022 Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and focus on your breath. If thoughts pop up, notice them and gently come back to the inhale/exhale.\n   \u2022 A free app like Insight Timer or Headspace\u2019s 3-minute sessions can guide you at first.\n\n2. Deep Breathing \u2013 the 4-7-8 technique (2 min)\n   \u2022 Inhale through the nose for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale through the mouth for 8. Repeat 4 rounds.\n   \u2022 This activates the body\u2019s relaxation response and can be done discreetly between meetings.\n\n3. Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) (10 min before bed)\n   \u2022 Starting with your feet, tense each muscle group for ~5 seconds then release for 10.\n   \u2022 Work upward to calves, thighs, abdomen, arms, shoulders, and face. Notice the contrast between tension and release to let stored stress drift away.\n\n4. Move Your Body Daily (at least 20 min)\n   \u2022 A brisk walk, short bike ride, or light stretching will boost mood-lifting endorphins and decrease physical tension from long desk hours.\n\n5. Micro-Breaks & Screen-Free Moments (1\u20132 min every hour)\n   \u2022 Stand, stretch, or simply look away from your screen to rest your eyes and reset your posture.\n\nSample Daily Flow\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nMorning   \u2013 5-minute breathing practice before opening email.\nLunch     \u2013 10-minute walk outside or around the office building.\nAfternoon \u2013 Two 2-minute stretch breaks (add calendar reminders).\nEvening   \u2013 PMR routine in bed to aid deeper sleep.\n\nRemember, consistency beats intensity. Even small, regular practices accumulate substantial benefits over time. Please let me know which of these resonates most or if you\u2019d like further guidance on any technique.\n\nTake care and speak soon,\n\n[Your Name]\nLicensed Therapist / Wellness Coach",
