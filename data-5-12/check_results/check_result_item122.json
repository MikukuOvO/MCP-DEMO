We\u2019ve been following Helping Hands Charity\u2019s work and are impressed by your impact in the community.\n\nWe\u2019re currently looking to collaborate with like-minded nonprofits on initiatives that strengthen local support networks. After reviewing our internal \u201cPartnership Opportunities\u201d brief, I believe there is strong overlap in our goals\u2014particularly around:\n\u2022 Tiered sponsorship options that can fund community projects\n\u2022 Opportunities for joint promotion to broaden both of our audiences\n\u2022 Possibilities for staff volunteer days or co-hosted fundraising events\n\nI would love to schedule a short call next week to learn more about Helping Hands\u2019 priorities and explore how we can create a mutually beneficial partnership.\n\nCould you let me know your availability over the next week or two? If there is someone else on your team I should loop in, please let me know.\n\nThank you for your time, and I look forward to the possibility of working together.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Title] | [Your Organization]\n[Phone]\n[Website]\n",
