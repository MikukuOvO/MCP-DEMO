I wanted to share a quick update on our student volunteer\u2019s recent involvement with Helping Hands Foundation.\n\nHours & Attendance\n\u2022 Since the start of the semester, the student has logged just over 40 volunteer hours.\n\u2022 They have consistently arrived early and often stayed after events to help with clean-up and debriefs.\n\nRoles & Contributions\n\u2022 Event set-up/tear-down for the weekly food-distribution drives.\n\u2022 Packaging and sorting donations in the warehouse.\n\u2022 Mentoring newer volunteers on safety protocols and workflow.\n\u2022 Assisting the outreach team by preparing thank-you notes for donors.\n\nFeedback from the Team\nStaff comments collected in our feedback log describe the student as punctual, eager to assist, and an inspiration to peers. Several team leads have remarked that the student\u2019s positive attitude keeps morale high during busy shifts and that their reliability makes planning much smoother.\n\nNext Steps\nThe student is scheduled to help at the upcoming distribution events on May 18 and May 25 and has expressed interest in joining the Summer Community Fair in June. Please let me know if there are additional opportunities or specific tasks where their skills might be most helpful.\n\nThank you for welcoming and supporting our student volunteer. If you need any further details or formal documentation of their hours, just let me know.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Title/Organization]\n[Contact Information]",
