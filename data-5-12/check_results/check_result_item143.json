  "email_content": "Hi Emily,\n\nGreat to hear from you, and congratulations on moving forward with your invention! Below are a few high-level guidelines that I\u2019ve found make a measurable difference when preparing a patent application. (Standard disclaimer: I\u2019m not acting as your attorney and this shouldn\u2019t replace individualized legal advice\u2014always run the final draft past a registered patent professional.)\n\n1. Nail the prior-art search early\n   \u2022 Spend time (or hire a search firm) to uncover anything remotely similar. Knowing the landscape up front lets you frame your claims around what\u2019s truly novel.\n\n2. Tell a clear \u201cstory\u201d in the specification\n   \u2022 Walk the examiner through the problem, why current solutions fall short, and how your invention bridges the gap. Clear flow + good figures = easier, faster examination.\n\n3. Draft claims with a tight core and optional fall-back positions\n   \u2022 Open with 1\u20132 narrow, well-supported independent claims that capture the essence of the invention.\n   \u2022 Add dependent claims that broaden scope or cover alternative embodiments so you have room to negotiate during prosecution.\n\n4. Highlight practical impact\n   \u2022 If your invention addresses areas like public health, food security, or climate tech, note this. Under certain USPTO programs (e.g., Track One Prioritized Examination or the Climate Change Mitigation Pilot), this can qualify you for expedited review.\n\n5. Mirror examiner preferences\n   \u2022 Once you know which art unit you\u2019ve landed in, skim a few patents the assigned examiner has recently allowed. Match their preferred level of technical detail and claim style. (Public PAIR / Patent Center makes this easy.)\n\n6. Keep formalities squeaky-clean\n   \u2022 Consistent terminology, reference numbers, claim antecedent basis, and proper support in the spec all help avoid needless Office actions.\n\n7. Plan for global filings early\n   \u2022 If you\u2019ll need protection outside the U.S., decide within 12 months whether to file a PCT application so you don\u2019t lose priority.\n\nNext steps\n   \u2022 Draft an outline of your specification and claims.\n   \u2022 Conduct (or commission) a detailed prior-art search and analyze the closest references.\n   \u2022 Schedule time with a patent attorney/agent to sanity-check claim scope and discuss any fast-track programs you might qualify for.\n\nIf you\u2019d like me to review a draft or brainstorm claim angles, just let me know. Happy to help!\n\nBest regards,\nJohn",
