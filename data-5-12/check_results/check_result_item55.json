  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nThanks for reaching out. I\u2019ve worked on a few high-rise foundations with similar load-bearing challenges, so I\u2019m happy to help.\n\nBelow is a quick overview that might be useful while you run your calculations:\n\n1. Load-path clarity \u2013 Make sure gravity loads are transferred directly to the central core. For SkyHigh we assumed a 60/40 split between the core and perimeter columns for service loads, then redistributed to 70/30 under ultimate loads to keep settlement within tolerance.\n2. Raft thickness vs. piling \u2013 Our preliminary optimisation showed that once column loads exceed ~85 MN, switching from a 3.0 m raft to a piled-raft (1.8 m raft + 60 m barrettes) cut differential settlement by ~35 % while keeping concrete volume roughly constant.\n3. Wind-induced overturning \u2013 For towers over 250 m we\u2019ve had success coupling the raft with a tension-pile \u201cbelt\u201d at the perimeter. This reduces overturning moments at the central core by ~18 %.\n4. Staged construction effects \u2013 Don\u2019t forget to model construction stages; early-age creep/shrinkage can shift the load distribution by a few percent, which in turn affects raft punching shear.\n\nI\u2019ve also collected more detailed notes, sample spreadsheets and FEM screenshots here:\nhttps://www.notion.so/SkyHigh-Tower-Structural-Analysis-1f00dc8fa0db81be8876c02bfffb3d16  (let me know if you need access).\n\nIf you\u2019d like to talk through any of this, I\u2019m free Wednesday after 2 pm or Thursday before noon.\n\nHope this helps\u2014let me know what you think.\n\nBest regards,\nJane",
