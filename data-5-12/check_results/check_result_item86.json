Key highlights:\n  \u2013 Fixed the intermittent transaction-processing bug that was causing duplicate ledger entries.\n  \u2013 Added the new data-storage encryption layer (AES-256 + key-rotation hooks) so we\u2019re now fully aligned with the Global Investments Inc. security spec.\n\n\u2022 Encryption algorithm \u2013 server-side unit tests are passing at 99.8 % coverage.  I\u2019m targeting full integration tests by Friday.\n\n\u2022 Client-side work \u2013 per the 02/15 meeting notes, this piece is yours.  Let me know if the new encryption wrapper or API docs raise any questions.\n\n\u2022 Open issues\n  \u2013 Jane is wrapping up the shareholder-data encryption edge-case (ETA 02/20).\n  \u2013 We still have a few documentation gaps in the analytics code.  I\u2019ll tackle those during the next doc sprint.\n\n\u2022 Next milestones\n  1. Merge request for client-side encryption handling \u2013 02/22.\n  2. Full end-to-end integration test run \u2013 02/24.\n  3. Internal milestone review \u2013 02/28.\n\nIf you hit any blockers or need additional context, just ping me on Slack or drop a quick note here. Otherwise, thanks for pushing the client-side piece forward!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
