  "email_content": "Dear Mrs. Thompson,\n\nThank you for reaching out and for your concern for Ethan. Over the past few weeks Ethan has needed to attend several follow-up medical appointments and manage some treatment-related side-effects, which have unfortunately required him to remain at home on certain days. The good news is that his physicians are pleased with his overall progress, and we expect his attendance to improve as his body adjusts to the current treatment schedule.\n\nWe anticipate that Ethan will be back in class this Wednesday, February 23, and, barring any unforeseen issues, he should be able to maintain a more regular attendance pattern moving forward. On days when he may still need to be out for medical reasons, I will continue to notify the front office in advance and provide a physician\u2019s note whenever necessary.\n\nWe appreciate the school\u2019s willingness to support Ethan academically during his absences. If there are specific assignments or materials that can be sent home or shared online, please let me know so I can help him stay current. Likewise, if there are any accommodations the team recommends, we are happy to work together to implement them.\n\nThank you again for your understanding and for the care you show Ethan.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nDr. Jane Doe\nParent/Guardian of Ethan Davis\n",
