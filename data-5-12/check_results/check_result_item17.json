  "email_content": "Hi MedTech Solutions Team,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. As we prepare for the scheduled software update to our scheduling and management system on April 15, I wanted to send a consolidated overview of our needs and key dates so we can keep both teams fully aligned.\n\n1. Maintenance Window\n   \u2022 Please confirm the exact start/end times of the downtime window and the time-zone.\n   \u2022 If this window changes, we\u2019ll need at least two weeks\u2019 notice so we can inform our staff and patients.\n\n2. Data Integrity & Backups\n   \u2022 We require a full, point-in-time backup of our environment immediately prior to the update.\n   \u2022 After the upgrade, kindly outline the verification steps you\u2019ll take to ensure no data loss or corruption.\n\n3. Release Documentation\n   \u2022 Please provide user documentation and/or release notes no later than Tuesday, 8 April so we can update our internal knowledge base.\n\n4. Staff Training & Support\n   \u2022 We\u2019d like to schedule a 1-hour virtual walk-through of the new features for our front-desk and clinical teams during the week of 11 April (any time between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. PT).\n   \u2022 Which support channels (phone, email, chat) will be staffed during the first 48 hours after go-live?\n\n5. Security & Compliance\n   \u2022 Our environment must remain fully HIPAA- and HITRUST-compliant.\n   \u2022 Please share a brief summary of the security enhancements included in this release and any recent penetration-test results you are able to disclose.\n\n6. Rollback & Contingency Plan\n   \u2022 In the unlikely event of an issue, what is the estimated recovery time to revert to the previous stable version?\n\n7. Staging/Preview Environment\n   \u2022 If possible, we\u2019d like access to a staging environment with the release candidate by Friday, 4 April so we can run basic workflow tests with sample data\u2014particularly around sensitive patient-record handling and the new appointment-booking flows.\n\nIf any of the above items present a challenge, please let us know as soon as possible so we can make the necessary adjustments on our side.\n\nThank you for your partnership, and please acknowledge receipt of this message at your earliest convenience.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Title]\n[Your Organization]\n[Phone]",
