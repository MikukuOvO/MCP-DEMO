  "email_content": "Hi Alex,\n\nThank you again for the time and care you put into your project. I\u2019ve finished my detailed review and wanted to share some thoughts that I hope will help you refine the paper further (and, if you choose, prepare it for a conference or portfolio piece).\n\nWhat\u2019s working well\n\u2022 Clear grasp of the key course concepts \u2013 you apply them correctly and thoughtfully.\n\u2022 Data analysis is carefully executed; the statistical methods you chose are appropriate and well-justified.\n\u2022 Visualizations are clean, well-labelled, and genuinely illuminate your findings.\n\u2022 Overall structure and writing style make the argument easy to follow.\n\nPlaces to strengthen\n\u2022 Focus your hypothesis: try distilling it into a single, specific sentence. A sharper statement will immediately tell readers exactly what you set out to test and why it matters.\n\u2022 Align every section with that hypothesis. As you revise, ask yourself after each paragraph, \u201cDoes this drive the central question forward?\u201d  Trimming or relocating material that doesn\u2019t serve the hypothesis will tighten the narrative.\n\u2022 Discussion depth: devote a short paragraph to the limitations of your data and how those limitations influence your conclusions. This will anticipate reader questions and strengthen the credibility of the study.\n\nConcrete next steps\n1. Rewrite the hypothesis in one sentence, then paste it at the top of a new outline.\n2. Map each existing section (Intro, Methods, Results, etc.) to that outline; flag paragraphs that don\u2019t have a clear link.\n3. Revise the introduction and discussion so they point explicitly back to the refined hypothesis and highlight the study\u2019s contribution.\n4. Give the paper one final language-level polish\u2014watch for passive voice and long sentences.\n\nOverall assessment\nAt this stage the project sits at a solid B+. With the refinements above, it could easily move into the A range.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to talk through any of these points or get feedback on a revised draft, just let me know\u2014happy to set up a short meeting.\n\nThanks again for your hard work, and congratulations on a strong draft!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\n",
