  "email_content": "Dear Mark,\n\nIt was a pleasure meeting you at the conference, and I\u2019m glad our conversation sparked further curiosity. Below is an overview of some of the key strategies our university uses to bolster student performance. I\u2019ve kept the examples broad to respect student privacy while still illustrating our approach.\n\n1) Early-alert analytics\n   \u2022 Every course feeds weekly gradebook data into a dashboard that flags missed assignments, attendance dips, or exam scores that fall two standard deviations below the cohort mean.\n   \u2022 Advisors reach out within 48 hours of a flag to schedule a quick check-in, shifting the conversation from \u201cWhat went wrong?\u201d to \u201cWhat do you need next?\u201d\n\n2) Holistic success teams\n   \u2022 Each student is assigned an adviser, a faculty mentor, and a peer mentor who meet jointly at least once a term. This triangulation keeps academic, career, and social-emotional goals aligned.\n   \u2022 We train the team to use strengths-based language so feedback feels supportive rather than punitive.\n\n3) Targeted skill-building resources\n   \u2022 Peer-led Supplemental Instruction (SI) sessions are embedded in historically challenging classes such as Calculus II and Organic Chemistry.\n   \u2022 A Learning Strategies Workshop series (time management, spaced repetition, exam debriefing) runs the first six weeks of every semester\u2014when habits are most malleable.\n\n4) Faculty development\n   \u2022 Mini-grants encourage instructors to redesign assignments around retrieval practice, low-stakes quizzes, and project-based learning.\n   \u2022 Over the past three years, 78 % of gateway STEM courses have adopted some form of active-learning protocol, leading to a 12-point increase in first-attempt pass rates.\n\n5) Integrated wellness support\n   \u2022 Counseling, mindfulness training, and financial-literacy coaching share a common intake form, reducing referral friction.\n   \u2022 Students who engage with both academic and wellness services persist at a rate nearly 9 % higher than those who use academic services alone.\n\n6) Continuous improvement through rapid-cycle assessment\n   \u2022 Each intervention is piloted with control/experimental sections; results are reviewed by a cross-functional committee every semester and scaled only if the effect size exceeds 0.2.\n\nOutcomes so far\n   \u2022 First-year retention: +5 % in four years.\n   \u2022 Average GPA in traditionally high-attrition majors: +0.23.\n   \u2022 Equity gap (URM vs. non-URM 4-year graduation): narrowed from 11 % to 6 %.\n\nI hope these snapshots spark ideas you can adapt to your own context. I\u2019m happy to dive deeper into any of the items above or share supporting materials\u2014just let me know what would be most helpful.\n\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name]\n",
