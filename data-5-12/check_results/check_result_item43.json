  "email_content": "Hi Lisa,\n\nWelcome aboard! I\u2019m excited that you\u2019ll be working with Ethan, and I wanted to share a few quick insights to help you hit the ground running.\n\n1. Daily Rhythm\n\u2022 7:00 AM \u2013 Wake-up & breakfast (oatmeal with sliced banana is his go-to).\n\u2022 10:00-11:00 AM \u2013 Puzzle time. He loves logic and jigsaw puzzles; it\u2019s a great window to build rapport.\n\u2022 12:30 PM \u2013 Lunch (simple sandwiches are a safe bet).\n\u2022 1:00-3:00 PM \u2013 Quiet reading or music (instrumental playlists work well). He\u2019s noise-sensitive, so keep volumes low.\n\u2022 3:00 PM \u2013 Therapy session (he\u2019s usually focused but may need a 5-minute transition).\n\u2022 6:00 PM \u2013 Dinner.\n\u2022 8:30 PM \u2013 Bedtime lights-out (routine is important\u2014dim lights and a short story help).\n\n2. Food Preferences & Environment\n\u2022 Prefers meals served warm; avoids cold or mixed-texture dishes like salads.\n\u2022 Favorite snacks: apple slices with peanut butter, crackers with cheese.\n\u2022 Meal times should be calm\u2014loud noises can cause him to disengage.\n\n3. Engagement Tips\n\u2022 Visual schedules or checklists make transitions smoother.\n\u2022 Positive reinforcement (verbal praise or a puzzle piece reward) keeps him motivated.\n\u2022 If he seems anxious, guided breathing and a short nature video usually reset his mood.\n\n4. Things to Watch\n\u2022 He occasionally fixates on completing a puzzle; give a 5-minute warning before switching activities.\n\u2022 He may refuse new foods at first\u2014introduce them gradually alongside preferred items.\n\nI\u2019ll share more detailed documents soon, but this should give you a solid starting point. Feel free to reach out with any questions.\n\nThanks for jumping in to support Ethan!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
