I\u2019m happy to share some broad, non-client-specific pointers that have served us well when preparing and filing motions in state court.  The suggestions below are high-level and should be adapted to the nuances of your jurisdiction and the particular judge\u2019s standing orders.\\n\\n1. Confirm the governing rules early.\\n   \u2022 Cross-check the latest edition of the state rules of civil procedure, any local county rules, and the judge\u2019s individual practices.  Pay special attention to page limits, font/spacing requirements, and timing rules for filing and service.\\n\\n2. Build a concise but complete record.\\n   \u2022 Identify the key documents that must accompany the motion (affidavits, exhibits, transcripts, etc.).  Make sure each exhibit is clearly tabbed and cited in the brief so the court can locate it quickly.\\n   \u2022 Where feasible, include a short practitioner\u2019s affidavit that lays out the procedural history in numbered paragraphs\u2014that often saves the court time and avoids confusion.\\n\\n3. Focus the brief on the dispositive issue.\\n   \u2022 Lead with the controlling rule or standard of review, then show\u2014fact by fact\u2014how it is met.  Judges routinely comment that the most persuasive motions are the ones that can be \u201cscanned\u201d and digested in minutes.\\n   \u2022 Use headings that state the desired finding (e.g., \u201cThe Contract Is Enforceable Because the Statute of Frauds Is Satisfied\u201d).  It guides the reader and becomes a roadmap for the eventual order.\\n\\n4. Draft a proposed order.\\n   \u2022 Even if not strictly required, attaching a proposed order that tracks the requested relief (with blank signature/date lines) demonstrates professionalism and can accelerate a ruling.\\n\\n5. Provide notice and confer.\\n   \u2022 Many judges require or appreciate a 3-to-5-day advance notice email or phone call to opposing counsel.  Even where not mandated, a short \u201cmeet-and-confer\u201d can pre-empt objections to format or scheduling.\\n\\n6. Mind the filing logistics.\\n   \u2022 Confirm whether your court accepts e-filing, paper filing, or both.  If hard copies are needed, prepare the correct number of bound sets plus any courtesy copies for chambers.\\n   \u2022 When filing electronically, combine documents into as few PDFs as the system allows\u2014courts often restrict the number of separate uploads.\\n\\n7. Calendar follow-ups.\\n   \u2022 Note the hearing date (if one is automatically assigned) or, if the court sets hearings separately, diary a reminder to request oral argument within the prescribed window.\\n   \u2022 Track the deadline for any reply brief; many jurisdictions give 5\u201310 days.\\n\\n8. Keep exhibits confidential when necessary.\\n   \u2022 If you anticipate sealing issues, file the motion in two parts: a public version with redactions and a sealed version containing the full exhibits, accompanied by a short motion to seal.\\n\\nIf you\u2019d like a checklist to run through before filing, feel free to let me know and I can send you a generic template we keep internally.\\n\\nI hope this helps, and please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out if anything needs clarification.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nJane Doe\\nCarter & Goldstein LLP\\n(555) 555-1234 | jdoe@cartergoldstein.com\"}"
