You mentioned you\u2019re always on the lookout for fresh writing tips, so I thought I\u2019d pass along a few insights from my creative-writing workshop this semester. I hope you find something useful!\\n\\n1. Show the Invisible \u2013 Our instructor reminds us that good scenes let readers infer emotion from action or setting rather than spelling it out. Instead of writing \u201cshe was lonely,\u201d you might describe how she reheats yesterday\u2019s coffee and sets two mugs on the table out of habit.\\n\\n2. Anchor Abstract Ideas in Sensory Detail \u2013 When you can attach sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch to an idea, it suddenly gains weight. One class exercise had us rewrite the sentence \u201ctime slipped away\u201d using only concrete images. The best line: \u201cThe kettle whistled itself hoarse and cooled before I noticed.\u201d\\n\\n3. Every Character Wants Something \u2013 Even if that \u201csomething\u201d is simply to be left alone, desire drives conflict and conflict drives story. A quick test: write down what each character would do if no one were watching.\\n\\n4. Revision Is Discovery \u2013 Our professor describes first drafts as \u2018thinking on paper.\u2019 In later passes we look for unintended patterns (recurring symbols, echoed images) and either lean into them or trim them away to make the design intentional.\\n\\n5. Read Like a Locksmith \u2013 Break a favorite passage down to see how it works: sentence length, verb choice, placement of surprises. Then tinker with those mechanics in your own prose.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re up for a tiny writing prompt: Write a scene in which two characters share a meal while an unspoken secret hangs in the air. The goal is to let readers feel the tension without either character ever naming the secret.\\n\\nLet me know if any of this sparks ideas\u2014or if you just want to trade reading recommendations. I\u2019d love to hear what you\u2019re working on.\\n\\nHappy writing!\\n\\n[Your Name]\"}"
