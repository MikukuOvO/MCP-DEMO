New Feature Roll-Out\\\\n   \u2022 The April release is expected to introduce enhanced appointment-scheduling workflows.\\\\n   \u2022 Could you provide user documentation or release notes no later than April 8th so we can update our internal knowledge base?\\\\n\\\\n4. Staff Training & Support\\\\n   \u2022 We would like a 1-hour virtual walk-through of the new features for our front-desk and clinical teams during the week of April 11th.  \\\\n   \u2022 Please confirm what support channels will be available during the first 48 hours after go-live.\\\\n\\\\n5.
