Below is a concise overview of the most recent federal immigration developments, based on the information compiled in The Advocate\u2019s Ledger and other reputable sources.\\n\\n1. Visa Quota Expansion\\n\u2022 Skilled-Worker Categories (EB-1/EB-2): Congress passed a bipartisan amendment that increases annual quotas by roughly 15 % for FY-2025. USCIS will open an additional filing window in mid-July; applicants already holding approved PERM certifications should prepare to file quickly.  \\n\u2022 Family-Preference Visas: No numerical changes, but USCIS has shortened the administrative processing goal from 12 to 8 months.\\n\\n2. New Temporary Protection Status (TPS)\\n\u2022 Countries Affected: Haiti, Nicaragua, Sudan, and Ukraine. Initial registration period is 18 May \u2013 18 Nov 2025.  \\n\u2022 Benefits: Protection from removal and eligibility for work authorization.  \\n\u2022 Action Step: Eligible clients should file Form I-821 and I-765 concurrently to avoid EAD delays.\\n\\n3. DACA/Dreamer Developments\\n\u2022 Although the program remains under judicial review, DHS has published a proposed rule to preserve DACA largely in its current form. Public comments are due 30 June 2025.  \\n\u2022 Renewal applications continue to be accepted; first-time applications are still on hold.\\n\\n4. Fee Adjustments\\n\u2022 USCIS filing fees will increase an average of 11 % on 1 August 2025. The I-129 (non-immigrant worker) petition sees the largest jump. We recommend filing any time-sensitive petitions before the increase takes effect.\\n\\n5. Enforcement Priorities\\n\u2022 ICE guidance (Feb 2025) re-emphasizes a focus on individuals posing national-security risks and recent border entries. Workplace raids remain rare, but employers must maintain accurate I-9 records.\\n\\nSuggested Next Steps for Havenbrook Immigrant Alliance\\n\u2022 Host an information session in early June focused on TPS eligibility and the fee changes\u2014happy to provide talking points or present remotely.  \\n\u2022 Update your resource handouts to reflect the new skilled-worker visa numbers and filing window.  \\n\u2022 Encourage DACA-eligible members to complete renewals at least 150 days before expiration.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you need deeper analysis on any item or sample outreach materials.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nJane Doe\\nImmigration Policy Analyst\\nThe Advocate\"}"
