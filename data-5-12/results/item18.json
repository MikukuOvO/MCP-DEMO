Below is a concise overview of our current dispute-resolution\\\",\\n  \\\"body\\\": \\\"Dear Mark,\\\\n\\\\nThank you for reaching out and for your continued interest in how Union Trust Bank manages customer complaints and disputes. Below is a concise overview of our current dispute-resolution framework, followed by answers to the specific points you raised.\\\\n\\\\n1. How a dispute is initiated \\\\n   \u2022  Customers can lodge a dispute through any branch, our 24-hour contact centre, secure online banking, or by written request.  \\\\n   \u2022  On receipt, we acknowledge the complaint within five (5) business days and assign a dedicated case manager. A reference number is supplied so the customer can track progress online or by phone.\\\\n\\\\n2. Investigation & provisional credit (card-transaction disputes)  \\\\n   \u2022  The case manager gathers supporting documentation (transaction record, receipts, merchant correspondence, etc.) and, where relevant, contacts the merchant or the card network.  \\\\n   \u2022  In line with card-scheme rules, we issue provisional credit within ten (10) business days whenever an investigation is expected to exceed that timeframe.  \\\\n   \u2022  Evidence is assessed by both our Payments Operations team and an independent Compliance officer to ensure objectivity.\\\\n\\\\n3. Timeframes & key milestones  \\\\n   \u2022  Standard cases \u2013 target resolution within thirty (30) calendar days.  \\\\n   \u2022  Complex cases \u2013 may extend to sixty (60) days; if that occurs, the customer receives a written update explaining the reason and revised timeline.  \\\\n   \u2022  Resolution letter \u2013 once a decision is reached we provide a written summary of our findings, any adjustments made, and next-step options.\\\\n\\\\n4. Documentation we request  \\\\n   \u2022  Dispute/chargeback form (digital or paper)  \\\\n   \u2022  Copy of the account statement showing the transaction(s) in question  \\\\n   \u2022  Relevant receipts, invoices, e-mails or chat transcripts with the merchant  \\\\n   \u2022  Photo ID (for first-time complainants who have not previously verified via our digital channel)\\\\n\\\\n5. Escalation avenues  \\\\n   \u2022  Internal: customers may ask for a secondary review by our Dispute Resolution Committee (headed by a senior vice-president who was not involved in the original decision).  \\\\n   \u2022  External: if still unsatisfied, they can raise the matter with the Financial Services Ombudsman or the appropriate card-scheme arbitration panel. We supply full contact details in the resolution letter.\\\\n\\\\n6. Recent process updates  \\\\n   \u2022  Electronic signature acceptance and a secure upload portal launched Q4-2021 to streamline documentation.  \\\\n   \u2022  Pandemic-related merchant-response extensions reduced from 45 to 30 days as of 1 February 2022, bringing us back in line with pre-COVID timeframes.\\\\n\\\\n7. Aggregate performance (2021)  \\\\n   \u2022  12,437 disputes processed  \\\\n   \u2022  93% resolved within 30 days  \\\\n   \u2022  1.8% escalated beyond the bank  \\\\n   \u2022  Customer-satisfaction rating: 4.5 / 5\\\\n\\\\n8. Glamour Gadgets case (publicly disclosable details)  \\\\n   \u2022  Dispute received 7 January; provisional credit issued Day 14.  \\\\n   \u2022  Investigation concluded Day 28; merchant accepted liability; permanent credit posted Day 30.  \\\\n   \u2022  Customer notified at every milestone through the secure portal and by e-mail.\\\\n\\\\nI hope the above answers your questions. If you need further details or would like to arrange an interview, please let me know \u2013 I\u2019m happy to provide additional materials, anonymised statistics, or walk you through a redacted case file.\\\\n\\\\nBest regards,\\\\n\\\\nJane Doe  \\\\nSenior Manager, Customer Advocacy  \\\\nUnion Trust Bank  \\\\n\u260e +1 (555) 987-6543  \\\\n\u2709 jane.doe@uniontrustbank.com\\\\n\\\"\\n}\",\"annotations\":null}"
