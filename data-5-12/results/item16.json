Executive Summary  \n\u2022 Overall, the organisation out-performed Q1 targets by ~12 % on average across all major KPIs.  \n\u2022 Employee engagement continues its positive trend (\u2191 9 % vs. Q4-24 survey), helped by mentoring and development initiatives.  \n\u2022 Budget execution for Q1 ran slightly under plan (-3 %), primarily due to later-than-planned hiring.  \n\u2022 The FY-25 budget remains on track, with current forecasts showing a <2 % variance from the approved ceiling.\n\n2. Performance Overview (Q1-25)  \nKPI Highlights  \n\u2022 Project Delivery: 94 % of Q1 milestones met on time (target 90 %).  \n\u2022 Product Quality: Code review defect rate dropped to 0.9 / KLOC (target \u2264 1.2 / KLOC).  \n\u2022 Marketing ROI: Digital campaigns generated 5.4\u00d7 return (target \u2265 5\u00d7).  \n\u2022 Customer Engagement: NPS averaged 66 (target 65).  \n\u2022 Cross-team Collaboration: Identified as the chief improvement area; see \u00a75 Recommendations.\n\n3. Budget Position \u2013 Q1 Actual vs. Plan  \n\u2022 Total Q1 Spend: 24.1 M (plan 24.9 M, variance \u20110.8 M / -3 %).  \n  \u2013 Primary drivers: Hiring delays (-0.4 M), lower travel & events costs (-0.3 M).  \n\u2022 Capex: 1.7 M (on plan).  \n\u2022 Opex: 22.4 M (-3 % vs. plan).  \nNo material compliance or over-spend exceptions noted.\n\n4. FY-25 Forecast (full year) \u2013 key departments  \nSoftware Development (budget 2.5 M)  \n\u2022 New-hires: 0.5 M  \n\u2022 Salary increments: 0.35 M  \n\u2022 Other ops costs (tools, infra, training): 1.65 M  \nDigital Marketing (budget 1.2 M)  \n\u2022 Campaign spend: 0.7 M  \n\u2022 Martech tools & analytics: 0.25 M  \n\u2022 Headcount & contractors: 0.25 M  \nOther departments remain within their approved envelopes; current aggregate forecast variance is +0.4 M (\u22481.1 %), well inside the 3 % management tolerance band.\n\n5. Key Insights & Risks  \n\u2022 Collaboration Gap: Performance metrics show slower hand-offs in cross-department initiatives. Without intervention this could reduce time-to-market by ~5 % in H2.  \n\u2022 Hiring Lag: While positive for short-term cashflow, prolonged delays may stretch existing teams and erode productivity in Q2-Q3.  \n\u2022 Inflationary Pressures: Salary and vendor rate inflation running 2-3 ppt above initial assumptions. We will revisit in the Q2 re-forecast.\n\n6. Recommendations  \n1. Launch two half-day cross-functional workshops focused on process integration (target completion: end-Q2).  \n2. Accelerate recruitment for critical engineering roles (net +4 hires by July) to pre-empt capacity constraints.  \n3. Build a 2 % contingency reserve into the marketing budget to absorb inflationary vendor costs.  \n4. Maintain quarterly employee-engagement pulse checks to keep tracking satisfaction gains.\n\n7.
