I\u2019m happy to provide the raw data tables or dig deeper on any point.\\n\\n1. Demographic Segmentation & Top-Line Needs\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\u2022 Gen Z (18-24) \u2013 68 % are mobile-only and rank fee-free checking + instant P2P payments as their top banking must-haves.  Social ads (TikTok/IG Reels) outperform display by 4\u00d7 for this cohort.\\n\u2022 Millennials (25-40) \u2013 Heavily value rewards.  57 % would switch banks for a debit card that earns 1 % cash back.  Podcasts and YouTube \u201chow-to finance\u201d content drive the best CPA.\\n\u2022 Gen X (41-56) \u2013 \u201cBalance growth + security\u201d is the recurring theme.  High-yield online savings is the foot-in-the-door product, but 43 % subsequently open a CD within 6 months.\\n\u2022 Boomers (57-75) \u2013 Prefer human guidance: 71 % still visit a branch at least once a month.  Direct mail with a personalized banker invitation converts 2.3\u00d7 higher than generic mailers.\\n\\n2. Life-Event Triggers\\n--------------------------------\\n\u2022 First Job/Paycheck (avg age 23): 81 % open their first primary checking within 90 days.  A $150 switch bonus + auto-pay messaging resonates.\\n\u2022 New Home Purchase: Mortgage customers are 5\u00d7 more likely to add a HELOC within 18 months if upsold during the closing process.\\n\u2022 New Baby/Adoption: Demand for 529 plans rises 4\u00d7 in the first year; educational webinars email series sees 48 % open rates.\\n\\n3. Digital vs Branch Behaviors\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\u2022 74 % of total log-ins happen on mobile, yet only 38 % know we offer in-app budgeting tools.  Awareness push = quick win.\\n\u2022 Customers who complete account opening fully online have a 32 % lower early-attrition rate\u2014worth highlighting the friction-free experience in creatives.\\n\\n4. Product Bundles & Cross-Sell\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\u2022 Checking + Savings + Credit Card bundle lifts 1-year retention from 83 % \u2192 93 %.\\n\u2022 When we add a \u201cfinancial fitness\u201d score inside online banking, cross-sell to personal loans increases by 19 %.\\n\\n5. Message Angles That Test Well\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\u2022 \\\"Banking that moves at the speed of your life\\\" \u2013 strong with Gen Z & Millennials (CTR +27 %).\\n\u2022 \\\"Make your idle cash earn more\\\" \u2013 resonates with Gen X and Boomers when paired with 1.25 % APY savings headline.\\n\u2022 Trust & Stability proof points (FDIC, 150-year heritage) boosts conversion among 55+ by 18 %.\\n\\nNext Steps\\n----------------\\nLet me know which segments or product areas you\u2019d like to prioritize and we can share creative briefs, audience lists, or deeper drill-downs.  I\u2019m available for a 30-min call this Thursday or Friday if that helps us lock the approach.\\n\\nLooking forward to collaborating!\\n\\nBest regards,\\nJohn\\n\\nJohn Doe\\nCustomer Insights | First Trust Bank\\njohn.doe@firsttrust.com | 555-555-1234\"}"
