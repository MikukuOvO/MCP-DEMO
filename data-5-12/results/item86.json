I\u2019ve worked on a few high-rise foundations with similar load-bearing challenges, so I\u2019m happy to help.\\\\n\\\\nBelow is a quick overview that might be useful while you run your calculations:\\\\n\\\\n1. Load-path clarity \u2013 Make sure gravity loads are transferred directly to the central core. For SkyHigh we assumed a 60/40 split between the core and perimeter columns for service loads, then redistributed to 70/30 under ultimate loads to keep settlement within tolerance.\\\\n2. Raft thickness vs. piling \u2013 Our preliminary optimisation showed that once column loads exceed ~85 MN, switching from a 3.0 m raft to a piled-raft (1.8 m raft + 60 m barrettes) cut differential settlement by ~35 % while keeping concrete volume roughly constant.\\\\n3. Wind-induced overturning \u2013 For towers over 250 m we\u2019ve had success coupling the raft with a tension-pile \u201cbelt\u201d at the perimeter. This reduces overturning moments at the central core by ~18 %.\\\\n4. Staged construction effects \u2013 Don\u2019t forget to model construction stages; early-age creep/shrinkage can shift the load distribution by a few percent, which in turn affects raft punching shear.\\\\n\\\\nI\u2019ve also collected more detailed notes, sample spreadsheets and FEM screenshots here:\\\\nhttps://www.notion.so/SkyHigh-Tower-Structural-Analysis-1f00dc8fa0db81be8876c02bfffb3d16  (let me know if you need access).\\\\n\\\\nIf you\u2019d like to talk through any of this, I\u2019m free Wednesday after 2 pm or Thursday before noon.\\\\n\\\\nHope this helps\u2014let me know what you think.\\\\n\\\\nBest regards,\\\\nJane\\\\n\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"id\\\": \\\"196c0120fc48f8b9\\\",\\n      \\\"subject\\\": \\\"Re: Surprise for Alex\\\",\\n      \\\"from\\\": \\\"mcp.test.dki2@gmail.com\\\",\\n      \\\"date\\\": \\\"Sun, 11 May 2025 08:58:51 -0700\\\",\\n      \\\"snippet\\\": \\\"Hi Mark, Great to hear from you!

Below is a concise briefing on the main challenges our immigrant neighbors are navigating, along with recent data points and story angles you might find useful.\\\\n\\\\n1. Legal status & policy uncertainty\\\\n   \u2022 ~10.5 M undocumented residents nationwide; many live in mixed-status families.\\\\n   \u2022 Fear of enforcement and the now-rescinded \u201cpublic-charge\u201d rule continues to\\\\n     depress enrollment in programs such as SNAP and Medicaid (Urban Institute, 2022).\\\\n\\\\n2. Economic vulnerability\\\\n   \u2022 Immigrants make up 17% of the U.S. labor force but are over-represented in\\\\n     low-wage front-line jobs (food processing, home health, hospitality).\\\\n   \u2022 Median household income: $57K vs $66K for native-born; 17% of immigrant-led\\\\n     households live below the poverty line (Pew, 2021).\\\\n   \u2022 During the pandemic, immigrant unemployment briefly topped 20%, and many\\\\n     were excluded from CARES Act stimulus because they filed taxes with an ITIN.\\\\n\\\\n3. Language access\\\\n   \u2022 One in four adult immigrants (25%) has limited English proficiency \u2014 the\\\\n     strongest predictor of earnings and health-care access.\\\\n   \u2022 Fewer than half of city agencies routinely translate material beyond Spanish,\\\\n     leaving East African, Haitian-Creole, Arabic, and other communities behind.\\\\n\\\\n4.

I\u2019m happy to share some broad, non-client-specific pointers that have served us well when preparing and filing motions in state court.  The suggestions below are high-level and should be adapted to the nuances of your jurisdiction and the particular judge\u2019s standing orders.\\\\n\\\\n1. Confirm the governing rules early.\\\\n   \u2022 Cross-check the latest edition of the state rules of civil procedure, any local county rules, and the judge\u2019s individual practices.  Pay special attention to page limits, font/spacing requirements, and timing rules for filing and service.\\\\n\\\\n2. Build a concise but complete record.\\\\n   \u2022 Identify the key documents that must accompany the motion (affidavits, exhibits, transcripts, etc.).  Make sure each exhibit is clearly tabbed and cited in the brief so the court can locate it quickly.\\\\n   \u2022 Where feasible, include a short practitioner\u2019s affidavit that lays out the procedural history in numbered paragraphs\u2014that often saves the court time and avoids confusion.\\\\n\\\\n3. Focus the brief on the dispositive issue.\\\\n   \u2022 Lead with the controlling rule or standard of review, then show\u2014fact by fact\u2014how it is met.  Judges routinely comment that the most persuasive motions are the ones that can be \u201cscanned\u201d and digested in minutes.\\\\n   \u2022 Use headings that state the desired finding (e.g., \u201cThe Contract Is Enforceable Because the Statute of Frauds Is Satisfied\u201d).  It guides the reader and becomes a roadmap for the eventual order.\\\\n\\\\n4. Draft a proposed order.\\\\n   \u2022 Even if not strictly required, attaching a proposed order that tracks the requested relief (with blank signature/date lines) demonstrates professionalism and can accelerate a ruling.\\\\n\\\\n5. Provide notice and confer.\\\\n   \u2022 Many judges require or appreciate a 3-to-5-day advance notice email or phone call to opposing counsel.  Even where not mandated, a short \u201cmeet-and-confer\u201d can pre-empt objections to format or scheduling.\\\\n\\\\n6. Mind the filing logistics.\\\\n   \u2022 Confirm whether your court accepts e-filing, paper filing, or both.  If hard copies are needed, prepare the correct number of bound sets plus any courtesy copies for chambers.\\\\n   \u2022 When filing electronically, combine documents into as few PDFs as the system allows\u2014courts often restrict the number of separate uploads.\\\\n\\\\n7. Calendar follow-ups.\\\\n   \u2022 Note the hearing date (if one is automatically assigned) or, if the court sets hearings separately, diary a reminder to request oral argument within the prescribed window.\\\\n   \u2022 Track the deadline for any reply brief; many jurisdictions give 5\u201310 days.\\\\n\\\\n8. Keep exhibits confidential when necessary.\\\\n   \u2022 If you anticipate sealing issues, file the motion in two parts: a public version with redactions and a sealed version containing the full exhibits, accompanied by a short motion to seal.\\\\n\\\\nIf you\u2019d like a checklist to run through before filing, feel free to let me know and I can send you a generic template we keep internally.\\\\n\\\\nI hope this helps, and please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out if anything needs clarification.\\\\n\\\\nBest regards,\\\\n\\\\nJane Doe\\\\nCarter & Goldstein LLP\\\\n(555) 555-1234 | jdoe@cartergoldstein.com\\\\n\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"id\\\": \\\"196bfec54797d3a3\\\",\\n      \\\"subject\\\": \\\"RE: Inquiry about Union Trust Bank\u2019s Dispute Resolution Process\\\",\\n      \\\"from\\\": \\\"mcp.test.dki2@gmail.com\\\",\\n      \\\"date\\\": \\\"Sun, 11 May 2025 08:17:38 -0700\\\",\\n      \\\"snippet\\\": \\\"Dear Mark, Thank you for your follow-up and for the opportunity to clarify how Union Trust Bank handles customer disputes.

Below is a concise, up-to-date overview that addresses the three areas you asked about and highlights the latest improvements to our programme.\\\\n\\\\n1. How a customer initiates a dispute\\\\n\u2022 Any branch, our 24-hour Contact Centre (1-800-UTB-HELP), secure Online Banking portal (Complaints \u25b8 New Dispute) or written letter to the Customer Advocacy Department.\\\\n\u2022 We acknowledge every complaint within five (5) business days, provide a unique case reference and assign a dedicated case manager who serves as the single point of contact.\\\\n\\\\n2. Expected processing times & milestones\\\\n\u2022 Standard cases \u2013 investigation and final response within 30 calendar days (reduced from 35 days in July 2024).\\\\n\u2022 Complex cases \u2013 may extend to 60 days; if so, the customer receives a written interim update at Day 30 explaining the delay and a revised timeline.\\\\n\u2022 Card-transaction disputes \u2013 if investigation is likely to exceed 10 business days, we issue provisional credit by Day 10 in accordance with card-scheme rules.\\\\n\u2022 A formal resolution letter is sent at closure summarising findings, any account adjustments and next-step options.\\\\n\\\\n3. Documentation typically requested\\\\n\u2022 Dispute/chargeback form (digital or PDF).\\\\n\u2022 Account statement showing the transaction(s) in question.\\\\n\u2022 Supporting evidence (receipts, invoices, e-mails or chat transcripts with the merchant, screenshots, etc.).\\\\n\u2022 Government-issued photo ID if the customer has not previously verified identity through our digital channel.\\\\n\\\\nRecent enhancements\\\\n\u2022 Q4-2021: Secure upload portal & electronic signature acceptance introduced (now used in 97 % of submissions).\\\\n\u2022 Jan 2024: Mobile self-service tracking tool launched, giving customers real-time status updates and the ability to add evidence from their phone.\\\\n\u2022 July 2024: Target timeframe lowered to 30 days; average resolution time in 2024 was 22.6 days with 94 % of cases closed inside the target.\\\\n\\\\nEscalation avenues\\\\n\u2022 Internal: A customer may request a secondary review by our Dispute Resolution Committee, chaired by a senior vice-president not involved in the original decision.\\\\n\u2022 External: If still dissatisfied, they may contact the Financial Services Ombudsman or (for card disputes) the relevant card-scheme arbitration panel. Full contact details are provided in every resolution letter.\\\\n\\\\nI hope this answers your questions, but please let me know if you need any additional data points, anonymised case studies or would like to schedule a call.\\\\n\\\\nBest regards,\\\\n\\\\nJane Doe\\\\nSenior Manager, Customer Advocacy\\\\nUnion Trust Bank\\\\n\u260e +1 (555) 987-6543\\\\n\u2709 jane.doe@uniontrustbank.com\\\\n\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"id\\\": \\\"196bfe337966e3e6\\\",\\n      \\\"subject\\\": \\\"Practical Wellness Tips to Ease Stress\\\",\\n      \\\"from\\\": \\\"mcp.test.dki2@gmail.com\\\",\\n      \\\"date\\\": \\\"Sun, 11 May 2025 15:07:41 +0000\\\",\\n      \\\"snippet\\\": \\\"Hi Mark, I hope you&#39;re doing well today.

As promised, I\u2019m sending over a short list of evidence-based wellness ideas that can help you feel more centered, especially during demanding work weeks.\\\\n\\\\n1. Mindfulness Meditation (5\u201310 min)\\\\n   \u2022 Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and focus on your breath. If thoughts pop up, notice them and gently come back to the inhale/exhale.\\\\n   \u2022 A free app like Insight Timer or Headspace\u2019s 3-minute sessions can guide you at first.\\\\n\\\\n2. Deep Breathing \u2013 the 4-7-8 technique (2 min)\\\\n   \u2022 Inhale through the nose for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale through the mouth for 8. Repeat 4 rounds.\\\\n   \u2022 This activates the body\u2019s relaxation response and can be done discreetly between meetings.\\\\n\\\\n3. Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) (10 min before bed)\\\\n   \u2022 Starting with your feet, tense each muscle group for ~5 seconds then release for 10.\\\\n   \u2022 Work upward to calves, thighs, abdomen, arms, shoulders, and face. Notice the contrast between tension and release to let stored stress drift away.\\\\n\\\\n4. Move Your Body Daily (at least 20 min)\\\\n   \u2022 A brisk walk, short bike ride, or light stretching will boost mood-lifting endorphins and decrease physical tension from long desk hours.\\\\n\\\\n5. Micro-Breaks & Screen-Free Moments (1\u20132 min every hour)\\\\n   \u2022 Stand, stretch, or simply look away from your screen to rest your eyes and reset your posture.\\\\n\\\\nSample Daily Flow\\\\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\\\\nMorning   \u2013 5-minute breathing practice before opening email.\\\\nLunch     \u2013 10-minute walk outside or around the office building.\\\\nAfternoon \u2013 Two 2-minute stretch breaks (add calendar reminders).\\\\nEvening   \u2013 PMR routine in bed to aid deeper sleep.\\\\n\\\\nRemember, consistency beats intensity. Even small, regular practices accumulate substantial benefits over time.
