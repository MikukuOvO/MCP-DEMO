I appreciate the thorough work that has gone into compiling these details, and I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity to review them so we can continue providing the best possible support for all of our students.\\n\\nI have read through the document and would like to share the following initial notes:\\n\\n1. Emily Watson (Epilepsy)\\n   \u2022 Seizure Action Plan: I have cross-checked the plan in Jane\u2019s Care Log, and everything aligns with the accommodations you have listed.  \\n   \u2022 Exam Environment: To minimize any potential triggers, please seat Emily away from flickering lights or direct sunlight and allow her extra time and supervised breaks should she need them.  \\n   \u2022 Emergency Preparation: I will ensure her rescue medication is available in the exam hall and that all invigilators are reminded of the procedure.\\n\\n2. Invigilator Briefing\\n   \u2022 I will circulate a one-page reference sheet outlining key medical accommodations (including dietary needs, sensory considerations, and emergency contacts) for each student requiring support.  \\n   \u2022 A short refresher session on recognizing and managing seizures will be offered to staff prior to the exam period.\\n\\n3. Ongoing Updates\\n   \u2022 Please let me know if any additional students have been identified for accommodations since this list was compiled so I can update our records promptly.  \\n   \u2022 I will conduct a quick audit this week to confirm all medical supplies are in place.\\n\\nIf there are any other areas you would like me to review or clarify, just let me know. I am happy to meet\u2014virtually or in person\u2014should you feel a discussion would be helpful.\\n\\nThank you again for your collaboration and commitment to our students\u2019 well-being.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\n\\nJane  \\nSchool Nurse\"}"
