  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. As promised, here are a few evidence-based practices you can integrate into your routine to support overall wellness:\n\n1. Mindful Breathing: Spend 1\u20133 minutes focusing on slow, even breaths, in through the nose and out through the mouth. This helps calm the nervous system and can be done anywhere.\n\n2. Progressive Muscle Relaxation: Starting with your feet, gently tense each muscle group for about 5 seconds and then release for 10\u201315 seconds. Work your way upward. This can ease physical tension and invite relaxation.\n\n3. Mini-Mindfulness Breaks: Choose a daily cue (e.g., waiting for the kettle to boil) to pause, notice the sensations around you, and bring your attention to the present moment.\n\n4. Movement: Aim for at least a brief walk or light stretching each day. Even 10 minutes of movement can boost mood and energy.\n\n5. Gratitude Journal: At the end of the day, jot down three things you appreciated. This simple habit trains the brain to notice positive experiences.\n\n6. Digital Boundaries: Pick one daily period (such as the first 30 minutes after waking) to stay off email and social media, allowing your mind to ease into the day without external input.\n\n7. Sleep Routine: Try to wind down with a consistent pre-sleep ritual\u2014dimming lights, reading a book, or doing gentle stretches\u2014to signal to your body that it\u2019s time to rest.\n\nFeel free to experiment and see which practices resonate most with you. Start small; consistency matters more than duration. Let me know if you have any questions or if you\u2019d like additional resources.\n\nTake care, and I look forward to our next session.\n\nWarm regards,\nJane",
