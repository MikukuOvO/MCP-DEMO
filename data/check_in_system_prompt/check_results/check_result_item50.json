  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nHere\u2019s a concise roundup of what I have so far:\n\n\u2022 Time-off window: Alex generally schedules his downtime for the middle of the week (most often Tuesday and Thursday). That should make either of those days the safest bet for a get-together without raising suspicion.\n\n\u2022 Home base: He\u2019s in the Evergreen Terrace neighborhood, only a few minutes from the main station. I\u2019ll pass the exact street number to you by phone or text so we keep it off email.\n\n\u2022 Extra touches & ideas:\n  \u2013 Gift: A rugged smartwatch that\u2019s popular with first responders (GPS, discreet alerts, health tracking) feels spot-on for him.\n  \u2013 Guest list: Because of his job and neighbors, it\u2019s best to keep the crowd small and low-key.\n  \u2013 Theme/Decor: Simple police-blue accents, maybe a custom badge-shaped cake\u2014nothing over-the-top that could embarrass him.\n\nLet me know if there\u2019s anything else you need, and I\u2019ll jump on it. Looking forward to pulling this off!\n\nCheers,\nJane",
