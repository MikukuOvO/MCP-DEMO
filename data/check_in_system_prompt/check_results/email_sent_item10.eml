Hi Sarah,

Here’s a concise status update on Project Falcon:

• Current phase: We’re in the implementation stage (Phase 2).
• Assets: The new campaign materials have been finalized and initial test-group feedback is very positive.
• Adjustments: We’ll refine the social-media approach based on recent suggestions and incorporate stakeholder feedback into the final plan.
• Next steps: Confirm the overall rollout timeline and prepare a summary deck for review at our catch-up early next week.

Let me know if you need anything else in the meantime.

Best,
John
