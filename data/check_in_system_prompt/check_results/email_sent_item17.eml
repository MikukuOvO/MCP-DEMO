Hi [Your Name],

Thank you for reaching out. Below is a summary of Greenleaf Health Center’s operational needs and considerations for the upcoming scheduling-system update:

1. Preferred Timing & Downtime
• Please schedule the update for an evening or weekend window, or keep any system outage as brief as possible (ideally no more than a few hours).  
• Advance notice of the exact maintenance window (minimum one week) will help us finalize patient and staff communications.

2. Appointment Volume During the Update Window
• The target week is one of our busier periods, with several dozen appointments and procedures already booked over a three-day span.  
• Service continuity is critical for both routine visits and time-sensitive procedures.

3. Contingency Planning
• We will set up a temporary manual (paper) scheduling log to capture new or changed appointments while the system is offline.  
• Staff will receive a brief refresher on the manual workflow beforehand so they can transition smoothly if needed.

4. Training on New Features
• A short orientation guide or demo video highlighting new functionality would be greatly appreciated.  
• If any interface changes affect appointment booking or patient-record workflows, please flag them so we can incorporate them into staff training.

5. Communication & Support
• Please provide a point of contact we can reach immediately during the maintenance window for any urgent issues.  
• A post-update checklist or confirmation that all data migrated correctly would help us verify system integrity.

Let me know if you need any additional information or if another timeframe would better accommodate both teams. We appreciate your partnership in ensuring a seamless transition.

Best regards,
Jane
Medical Administrative Assistant
