Dear Alex,

Thank you for submitting your project. I’ve had a chance to review your work and wanted to share some feedback that I hope will be helpful as you continue refining your research:

• Strengths: Your data analysis is thoughtfully executed, and the visualizations you included effectively illustrate your findings. Overall, the presentation flows logically and demonstrates a solid grasp of the course material.

• Area for improvement: I encourage you to tighten the wording of your hypothesis and research question so that the central focus is crystal-clear from the outset. A concise, sharply defined statement will strengthen the overall impact of your paper.

Please let me know if you’d like to discuss any of these points in more detail or schedule a brief meeting—happy to clarify or dive deeper into specific aspects.

Best regards,
Professor Jane
