Hi [Your Name],

I hope you’re doing well. As requested, here’s the most up-to-date summary of OptiLife’s requirements for the HealthHub platform:

• Seamless integration with our existing voluntary wellness programs so that employees can move between current offerings and HealthHub without duplicate data entry.
• Ability for employees to set, track, and manage their individual health goals within the platform.
• Delivery of personalized health insights based on an employee’s tracked activities and goals to encourage sustained engagement.
• A library of wellness challenges (e.g., step counts, mindfulness streaks, nutrition goals) that can be launched company-wide or targeted to specific groups to boost participation.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or clarification. I look forward to our continued collaboration on making HealthHub a success.

Best regards,
Jane
Health Program Coordinator
OptiLife Inc.
