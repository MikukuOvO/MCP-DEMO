I\u2019ve had a chance to review your work and wanted to share some feedback that I hope will be helpful as you continue refining your research:\n\n\u2022 Strengths: Your data analysis is thoughtfully executed, and the visualizations you included effectively illustrate your findings. Overall, the presentation flows logically and demonstrates a solid grasp of the course material.\n\n\u2022 Area for improvement: I encourage you to tighten the wording of your hypothesis and research question so that the central focus is crystal-clear from the outset. A concise, sharply defined statement will strengthen the overall impact of your paper.\n\nPlease let me know if you\u2019d like to discuss any of these points in more detail or schedule a brief meeting\u2014happy to clarify or dive deeper into specific aspects.\n\nBest regards,\nProfessor Jane",
