Hi Dr. Strauss,

I’ve compiled the aggregated prevalence statistics from the population I counsel, fully de-identified in accordance with privacy requirements. The current dataset includes:

• BRCA1 pathogenic/likely pathogenic mutation – observed in approximately 5 % of individuals in the cohort.

No individual-level information is contained in these figures. If you would like the data in a different format or need additional markers as they become available, just let me know.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
Genetic Counselor
