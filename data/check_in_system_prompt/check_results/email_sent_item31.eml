Hi Sarah,

Thanks for sending over the background materials—I’ve had a look through them. Below is a concise snapshot of recent insights from First Trust Bank’s customer data that should help steer the campaign.

1. Digital-first customers (roughly one-third of active users)
   • Heavy mobile-app engagement, value speed and fee transparency.
   • Respond well to short-form video, social ads, and in-app offers.

2. Young families & prospective home buyers (about a quarter of the base)
   • Actively researching mortgage and savings products.
   • Educational content (e.g., quick guides, webinars) coupled with trust-building narratives performs best.

3. Established professionals (around one-fifth)
   • Interested in wealth-building and bundled services.
   • Appreciate personalised recommendations and loyalty-style perks.

4. Small-business owners (smaller but high-value segment)
   • Looking for cash-flow management tools and integrated payments.
   • Engage strongly with case-study stories that showcase success examples.

5. Cross-segment takeaways
   • Security, ease of use, and community involvement are consistently cited as key brand factors.
   • Campaigns that highlight our security credentials early, showcase community initiatives, and demonstrate mobile functionality generate higher engagement.

Let me know if you’d like a deeper dive or have any follow-up questions. I’m happy to expand on any area.

Best regards,
John
