Hi Mark,

As requested, I’ve pulled together the latest performance and budget snapshot for Software Development. Below are the headline figures; I’ll package the full detailed deck and underlying tables for your review by early next week.

Performance Highlights (FY-to-date)
• Delivery timeliness: projects delivered on schedule ~92 % (target 90 %).
• Code quality: post-release defect rate down roughly 15 % versus the previous period.
• Sprint velocity: average story points completed per sprint up ~8 % quarter-over-quarter.
• Customer-reported incidents reduced by about 10 % since last quarter.

Budget Position (YTD, USD)
• Forecast: ~1.4 M
• Actual spend: ~1.3 M → ~7 % under forecast.
  – Main savings: deferred vendor contracts and lower cloud expenditure.
  – Travel & training slightly over budget (+5 %), but immaterial overall.

Head-count / Staffing Updates
• Net change of +2 FTE this quarter (three new engineers onboarded, one departure).
• Current open requisitions: four (back-end x2, front-end x1, QA x1); interviews ongoing.
• Ramp-up costs already reflected in the Q3 forecast.

Emerging Trends & Variances
• Infrastructure cost trendlines indicate a possible uptick next quarter as new micro-services go live; Finance has flagged a ~6 % increase in projected platform fees.
• Continued efficiency gains in defect remediation are freeing ~4 % of engineering capacity that can be redirected to roadmap items.
• If all planned hires close on time, the salary line is expected to track ~3 % above the original FY forecast; offset opportunities exist in the vendor line.

Next Steps
I’m consolidating supporting charts (burn-down, quarterly budget roll-up, variance waterfall) and will circulate the full deck by early next week. Let me know if there are any additional cuts or focus areas you’d like included.

Thanks, and please let me know if the timeline works or if you need anything else.

Best regards,
Jane
