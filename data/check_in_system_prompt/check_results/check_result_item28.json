  "email_content": "Dear Mrs. Thompson,\n\nThank you for reaching out about Ethan. I appreciate the school\u2019s efforts to support him.\n\nCurrent status\n\u2022 Ethan continues to manage a chronic medical condition that can cause periodic muscle fatigue and reduced stamina. Overall, he remains in good spirits and is responding as expected to his current treatment plan.\n\nReasons for his recent absences\n\u2022 The absences you have noted were related to scheduled medical appointments and short periods of rest that were recommended after recent treatment adjustments. These were preventive measures to help him recover comfortably and safely.\n\nRecommendations for school support\n\u2022 Provide flexibility with physical activities; please allow modified or alternative options during physical education and recess when he feels tired.\n\u2022 Offer extra time for classwork, projects, and assessments, as his energy levels may fluctuate.\n\u2022 Permit brief rest breaks and access to a quiet area when he experiences fatigue.\n\u2022 Ensure he has water and healthy snacks readily available throughout the day.\n\u2022 Consider allowing the use of a scribe, note-taking assistance, or electronic device during writing-intensive tasks if he shows signs of muscle fatigue in his hands.\n\u2022 Keep open lines of communication with Ethan\u2019s parents and with me regarding any changes you observe in his stamina or comfort at school.\n\nPlease let me know if the school requires any additional documentation or if you have further questions. Thank you for your continued support of Ethan\u2019s well-being and educational success.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nJane Doe, MD\nPediatrician",
