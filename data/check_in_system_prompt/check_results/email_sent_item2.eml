Hi Emily,

Great to hear from you. Below is a concise overview of approaches I have found especially useful when working with clients who present with anxiety disorders. Feel free to adapt any of these ideas to fit the individual needs and contexts of your cases.

1. Comprehensive Assessment
   • Use standardized measures (e.g., GAD-7, Beck Anxiety Inventory) alongside clinical interviews to capture symptom severity, functional impact, and specific triggers.
   • Screen for comorbidities (depression, substance use, OCD-spectrum) to inform case formulation.

2. Psychoeducation
   • Normalize the physiological stress response and differentiate helpful vs. unhelpful anxiety.
   • Introduce the CBT “thoughts–feelings–behaviors” model early so clients can start tracking automatic thoughts.

3. Cognitive-Behavioral Interventions
   • Cognitive restructuring: Identify cognitive distortions (catastrophizing, probability overestimation) and practice balanced alternatives.
   • Exposure hierarchy: Gradually face feared situations or sensations, beginning with mild triggers and progressing once habituation is achieved.
   • Skills training: Relaxed breathing (4-7-8 or box breathing), progressive muscle relaxation, and grounding (5-4-3-2-1) to manage acute spikes.

4. Mindfulness & Acceptance Components
   • Brief, daily mindfulness practices (5–10 minutes) help clients notice anxiety without immediate avoidance.
   • ACT-informed values exercises can reduce experiential avoidance and build motivation for exposure work.

5. Lifestyle & Relapse Prevention
   • Encourage regular movement, balanced nutrition, and sleep hygiene; these non-specific factors often move the needle.
   • Develop a “maintenance plan” that includes ongoing self-monitoring and scheduled booster sessions.

6. Measuring Progress
   • Re-administer symptom scales every few sessions and routinely solicit subjective reports to guide pacing.
   • Celebrate incremental wins to strengthen self-efficacy.

Additional Materials
I’ve uploaded more detailed CBT protocols and reading lists to the shared Notion space (look for the pages titled “Cognitive-Behavioral Techniques for Anxiety” and “Recommended Reading on Anxiety Disorders”). Let me know if you have trouble accessing them.

Hope this helps—happy to discuss any specific challenges you’re facing.

Warm regards,
