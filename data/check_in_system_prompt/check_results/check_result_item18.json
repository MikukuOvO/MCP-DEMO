  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nThank you for reaching out. Below is a concise overview of Union Trust Bank\u2019s dispute resolution process that you are welcome to reference in your article. I have also summarized the key points we touched on in our earlier correspondence.\n\n1. Initiating a Dispute\n\u2022  Customers can raise a dispute 24/7 through online banking, phone, or in-branch.\n\u2022  We acknowledge receipt within one business day and assign a dedicated dispute specialist to the case.\n\n2. Information Gathering & Provisional Credit\n\u2022  The specialist requests any supporting documents (e-mail confirmations, receipts, correspondence with the merchant, etc.).\n\u2022  In line with Regulation E (for debit transactions) and Regulation Z / card-network rules (for credit transactions), provisional credit is generally provided within 10 business days if we need longer to investigate.\n\n3. Investigation\n\u2022  Evidence is collected from the customer, merchant, payment processor, and the relevant card network.\n\u2022  Our fraud-analytics team reviews transaction data, geolocation indicators, device/browser fingerprints, and prior account activity.\n\u2022  If additional merchant documentation is required, we open a retrieval request through the network and allow the merchant up to 14 days to respond.\n\n4. Decision & Customer Notification\n\u2022  A final determination is typically reached within 45 calendar days (90 days for international or point-of-sale PIN disputes).\n\u2022  The customer receives a written outcome letter explaining the decision, any permanent credit/debit adjustments, and the evidence that informed the ruling.\n\n5. Appeals & Escalation\n\u2022  If the customer disagrees, they may request an internal appeal that is reviewed by a separate senior panel.\n\u2022  Should the outcome remain unsatisfactory, customers may pursue mediation via our external Ombudsman Service or file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\n\n6. Customer Support & Transparency\n\u2022  Throughout the process, customers can monitor status updates online or contact their assigned specialist directly.\n\u2022  Detailed case notes are retained for seven years in compliance with record-keeping regulations.\n\nIllustrative Example (Anonymized)\nIn a recent high-value credit-card dispute involving a specialty electronics merchant, we followed the above steps: provisional credit was issued within the initial 10-day window, the merchant supplied additional documentation, and our investigation ultimately sided with the cardholder based on mismatched delivery records. The timeline from dispute filing to final resolution was just under six weeks.\n\nI hope this overview is helpful. Let me know if you need further clarification or additional context for your piece.\n\nBest regards,\nJane Doe\nCustomer Service & Dispute Resolution Specialist\nUnion Trust Bank\n",
