Hi Lisa,

Thank you for offering to support Ethan. Below is an overview that should give you a solid starting point. Let me know if anything needs more detail and I’ll be happy to follow up.

1. General Rhythm
• Ethan does best with a predictable day. He usually wakes early, has a calm morning routine that includes breakfast and light movement, spends mid-morning on brain-teaser activities, and enjoys lunch in the early afternoon. The later part of the afternoon is set aside for quiet interests or appointments, followed by dinner in the early evening, a favorite nature programme, and an early, consistent bedtime.

2. Interests & Motivators
• Puzzle games, especially jigsaws and logic puzzles.
• Anything related to animals—visits to a zoo or watching animal documentaries are big hits.
• Water play and swimming lessons.
• Drawing and painting; he keeps a small art kit handy.
• Simple, familiar foods (oatmeal, fruit, uncomplicated sandwiches) work well.

3. Communication & Interaction
• He responds best to clear, direct language and appreciates having two simple choices rather than open-ended questions.
• Visual cues (picture cards or a short written list) help him understand what is coming next.
• If he starts to look unsettled—checking the door, rubbing his hands, or going quiet—it’s usually his way of signaling that he needs a short break somewhere calm. A quick reset in a quieter spot works wonders.
• Positive reinforcement (“Great job finishing the puzzle!”) motivates him more than verbal corrections.

4. Environmental Tips
• Give a gentle heads-up before transitions such as leaving the house or finishing an activity.
• Keep background noise and strong smells low when possible.
• Consistency is key—using the same phrases and order of activities helps him feel secure.

5. Additional Resources
I keep brief notes in my workspace on his daily rhythm, favorite activities, and strategies that work well. If you’d like access, just let me know and I can share view-only links.

I hope this helps you feel prepared for your first sessions with Ethan. Thanks again for your willingness to work with him—he’ll benefit from your support, and we really appreciate it.

Warm regards,
Jane
