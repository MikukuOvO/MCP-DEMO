  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nThanks for sending over the background materials\u2014I\u2019ve had a look through them. Below is a concise snapshot of recent insights from First Trust Bank\u2019s customer data that should help steer the campaign.\n\n1. Digital-first customers (roughly one-third of active users)\n   \u2022 Heavy mobile-app engagement, value speed and fee transparency.\n   \u2022 Respond well to short-form video, social ads, and in-app offers.\n\n2. Young families & prospective home buyers (about a quarter of the base)\n   \u2022 Actively researching mortgage and savings products.\n   \u2022 Educational content (e.g., quick guides, webinars) coupled with trust-building narratives performs best.\n\n3. Established professionals (around one-fifth)\n   \u2022 Interested in wealth-building and bundled services.\n   \u2022 Appreciate personalised recommendations and loyalty-style perks.\n\n4. Small-business owners (smaller but high-value segment)\n   \u2022 Looking for cash-flow management tools and integrated payments.\n   \u2022 Engage strongly with case-study stories that showcase success examples.\n\n5. Cross-segment takeaways\n   \u2022 Security, ease of use, and community involvement are consistently cited as key brand factors.\n   \u2022 Campaigns that highlight our security credentials early, showcase community initiatives, and demonstrate mobile functionality generate higher engagement.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a deeper dive or have any follow-up questions. I\u2019m happy to expand on any area.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\nCustomer-Service Department\nFirst Trust Bank",
