Hi Alex,

As requested, here is the anonymized, portfolio-level customer engagement data pulled from my notes:

• Customers aged 25–40 represent roughly 38% of our active user base, with a median monthly spend of about $2,800.
• Mobile banking adoption is strongest among customers under 30, with approximately 72% using the mobile app for at least half of their transactions.
• Mortgage and auto loans together account for about 45% of total loan balances.
• Debit card usage has increased by roughly 18% over the past year, likely driven by greater contactless-payment adoption.

All figures are fully aggregated to maintain customer privacy. Let me know if you need any additional breakdowns or have other questions.

Best regards,
Jane
Union Trust Bank
