  "email_content": "Hi Team,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I\u2019d like to share a quick overview of a few upcoming changes to our office space and the way we work.\n\nOffice Environment\n\u2022 Renovation of the ground floor will begin next week. During this period all common work areas and the break room on that floor will be refreshed. We\u2019ll temporarily relocate to the upper floors, and signage will guide you to available desks and collaboration zones.\n\u2022 We\u2019re looking into stabilizing temperature settings across open areas and creating designated quiet zones to support focused work. Feel free to share additional suggestions.\n\nWorkflow Enhancements\n\u2022 We\u2019re rolling out AgileBoost, a lightweight framework that builds on our current agile practices. Key points:\n  \u2013 Shorter, iterative cycles with clearly defined objectives.\n  \u2013 Cross-functional collaboration encouraged at every stage.\n  \u2013 Continuous feedback loops so teams can adapt quickly.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next\n\u2022 A brief orientation on AgileBoost will be scheduled soon.\n\u2022 Facilities will send a floor-plan update before renovation starts.\n\nPlease reach out if you have questions or ideas.\n\nThank you for your flexibility and support.\n\nBest,\nJohn",
