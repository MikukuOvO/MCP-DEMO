Dear Oakwood Teaching Alliance,

Thank you for sharing the updated list of student accommodations.

I have cross-checked the document with our current medical and learning records. At this time, all accommodations listed match the guidance we have on file.

• Emily Watson – continues to receive her established exam-related supports (separate, quiet setting and extended time).
• All other students – accommodations remain unchanged and appropriate based on their most recent evaluations.

Please let me know if you notice any new concerns in the classroom or would like to discuss further adjustments. I’m happy to collaborate to ensure every student receives the support they need.

Thank you for your continued partnership.

Warm regards,

Jane 
School Nurse, Oakwood Elementary
