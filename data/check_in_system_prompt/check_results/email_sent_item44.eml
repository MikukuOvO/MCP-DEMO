Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out and for dedicating coverage to this topic.

Below is a concise overview drawn from my recent work with Harmony Alliance. I’ve removed all identifying information to safeguard community members’ privacy, but I’m happy to provide additional context or connect you with advocates who can speak on the record.

Key challenges we routinely observe
• Health care: Many undocumented neighbors delay or forgo preventive care, relying instead on emergency rooms because of cost, lack of insurance, and fear of disclosing status.
• Education: Children often face enrollment hurdles and limited access to advanced or extracurricular programs; older youth are ineligible for most financial-aid options, making higher education inaccessible.
• Employment & wages: Without work authorization people are pushed into informal jobs, exposing them to wage theft, unsafe conditions, and little recourse.
• Legal uncertainty & enforcement: Shifting federal guidance and periodic enforcement actions create persistent anxiety that discourages folks from seeking help or reporting crimes.
• Language access & transportation: Limited translation services and inadequate public transit compound daily obstacles.

Snapshot data
• Harmony Alliance’s recent “Nourish Neighbors” food drive reached more than fifty immigrant households in the past month – a sign of ongoing food insecurity despite community resourcefulness.
• Attendance at our weekly pro-bono legal-aid clinic has roughly doubled since early this year.

Illustrative (de-identified) anecdotes
• A mother who fled violence abroad cannot secure steady work, leaving her family one missed paycheck away from homelessness.
• A father of two is scrambling to keep his family together after a recent neighborhood immigration sweep.
• A high-achieving student deferred college because documentation barriers block access to scholarships and in-state tuition.

What community members say they need most
• Affordable, confidential health clinics
• Expanded language-access services in schools and public agencies
• Clear, consistent information about rights during encounters with law-enforcement or federal agencies
• Increased funding for pro-bono immigration legal assistance

Let me know your deadline and if you’d like to delve deeper into any of these areas. I’m also glad to put you in touch with service providers or policy experts if that would help your piece.

Best regards,

Jane
Harmony Alliance
