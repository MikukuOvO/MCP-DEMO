Hi Sarah,

Here’s a concise recap of our recent discussion at the Global Business Hub:

• Financial Overview – We reviewed Innovatech Solutions’ current financial health, including the completion of our latest funding round and an outline of recent expenditure trends.

• Strategic Partnerships & Market Expansion – We agreed to pursue partnerships with major tech firms and mapped out a South American and Asian market entry target for later this year.

• Q2 Product Launch – We finalized next steps for the upcoming launch, focusing on a digital-first marketing approach aimed at tech-savvy SMEs.

• Regulatory Landscape – We noted potential policy changes that could affect import costs and net-neutrality, and agreed to monitor and engage as needed.

Let me know if any points need adjustment or additional detail.

Best,
John
