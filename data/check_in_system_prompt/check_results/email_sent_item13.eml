Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. As promised, here are a few evidence-based practices you can integrate into your routine to support overall wellness:

1. Mindful Breathing: Spend 1–3 minutes focusing on slow, even breaths, in through the nose and out through the mouth. This helps calm the nervous system and can be done anywhere.

2. Progressive Muscle Relaxation: Starting with your feet, gently tense each muscle group for about 5 seconds and then release for 10–15 seconds. Work your way upward. This can ease physical tension and invite relaxation.

3. Mini-Mindfulness Breaks: Choose a daily cue (e.g., waiting for the kettle to boil) to pause, notice the sensations around you, and bring your attention to the present moment.

4. Movement: Aim for at least a brief walk or light stretching each day. Even 10 minutes of movement can boost mood and energy.

5. Gratitude Journal: At the end of the day, jot down three things you appreciated. This simple habit trains the brain to notice positive experiences.

6. Digital Boundaries: Pick one daily period (such as the first 30 minutes after waking) to stay off email and social media, allowing your mind to ease into the day without external input.

7. Sleep Routine: Try to wind down with a consistent pre-sleep ritual—dimming lights, reading a book, or doing gentle stretches—to signal to your body that it’s time to rest.

Feel free to experiment and see which practices resonate most with you. Start small; consistency matters more than duration. Let me know if you have any questions or if you’d like additional resources.

Take care, and I look forward to our next session.

Warm regards,
Jane
