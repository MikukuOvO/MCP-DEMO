Hi Mark,

I’ve reviewed Eric’s personnel file and the information we have on his recent absences. His time away from work is fully supported by appropriate documentation, and we are coordinating with him to ensure that any needed workplace adjustments are in place. At this point, he anticipates returning on a flexible schedule as required. I’ll keep you informed of any developments that might affect team scheduling or workload.

Please let me know if you need anything further.

Best regards,
Jane
