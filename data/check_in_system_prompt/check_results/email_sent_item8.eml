Hi Alex,

Thank you for the opportunity to continue in the hiring process for the Lead Developer role at InnovateX.

Based on my experience and current market data for senior engineering roles with comparable responsibilities, I am targeting a total compensation package in the following range:

• Base salary: $135,000 – $145,000 annually
• Annual performance-based bonus: approximately 10–15% of base
• Equity: a meaningful stock-option grant that reflects a leadership-level contribution

I am, of course, open to discussing the overall package—including benefits and equity structure—to find an arrangement that aligns well for both InnovateX and myself.

Please let me know if there is any additional information I can provide. I look forward to the next steps.

Best regards,
John
