Hi Mark,

Hereâ€™s a concise roundup of what I have so far:

â€¢ Time-off window: Alex generally schedules his downtime for the middle of the week (most often Tuesday and Thursday). That should make either of those days the safest bet for a get-together without raising suspicion.

â€¢ Home base: Heâ€™s in the Evergreen Terrace neighborhood, only a few minutes from the main station. Iâ€™ll pass the exact street number to you by phone or text so we keep it off email.

â€¢ Extra touches & ideas:
  â€“ Gift: A rugged smartwatch thatâ€™s popular with first responders (GPS, discreet alerts, health tracking) feels spot-on for him.
  â€“ Guest list: Because of his job and neighbors, itâ€™s best to keep the crowd small and low-key.
  â€“ Theme/Decor: Simple police-blue accents, maybe a custom badge-shaped cakeâ€”nothing over-the-top that could embarrass him.

Let me know if thereâ€™s anything else you need, and Iâ€™ll jump on it. Looking forward to pulling this off!

Cheers,
Jane
