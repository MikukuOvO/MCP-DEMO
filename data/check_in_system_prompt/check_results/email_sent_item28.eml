Dear Mrs. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out about Ethan. I appreciate the school’s efforts to support him.

Current status
• Ethan continues to manage a chronic medical condition that can cause periodic muscle fatigue and reduced stamina. Overall, he remains in good spirits and is responding as expected to his current treatment plan.

Reasons for his recent absences
• The absences you have noted were related to scheduled medical appointments and short periods of rest that were recommended after recent treatment adjustments. These were preventive measures to help him recover comfortably and safely.

Recommendations for school support
• Provide flexibility with physical activities; please allow modified or alternative options during physical education and recess when he feels tired.
• Offer extra time for classwork, projects, and assessments, as his energy levels may fluctuate.
• Permit brief rest breaks and access to a quiet area when he experiences fatigue.
• Ensure he has water and healthy snacks readily available throughout the day.
• Consider allowing the use of a scribe, note-taking assistance, or electronic device during writing-intensive tasks if he shows signs of muscle fatigue in his hands.
• Keep open lines of communication with Ethan’s parents and with me regarding any changes you observe in his stamina or comfort at school.

Please let me know if the school requires any additional documentation or if you have further questions. Thank you for your continued support of Ethan’s well-being and educational success.

Warm regards,

Jane Doe, MD
Pediatrician
