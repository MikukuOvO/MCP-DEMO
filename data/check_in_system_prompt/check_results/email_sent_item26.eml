Hi Angela,

Here is the latest update on the Zenith Wellness Initiative:

• Participation continues to grow; we’re currently seeing close to eight-in-ten employees engaged in at least one activity.

• Engagement highlights:
   – Utilization of gym memberships and on-site fitness classes remains strong, with lunchtime sessions consistently filling up.
   – Nutrition and stress-management workshops have received positive post-session feedback, with employees noting practical take-aways they can apply immediately.

• Health profile assessments are underway for new participants, enabling us to refine individual wellness plans. Early aggregate trends point to improvements in general cardiovascular fitness indicators and overall energy levels.

• Success stories: A number of early participants have reported meaningful progress and volunteered to serve as peer ambassadors during our upcoming “Wellness Week.” Their involvement should help maintain momentum and encourage wider participation.

• Next steps for the coming quarter:
   – Launch a friendly, team-based activity challenge to sustain engagement.
   – Expand the mental-well-being resources with brief mindfulness sessions before work.
   – Circulate a concise survey to capture suggestions and gauge satisfaction for continuous improvement.

Please let me know if you’d like any additional detail or would like to discuss the next steps further.

Best regards,
John
