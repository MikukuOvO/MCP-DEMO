Hi Mark,

Here’s a concise snapshot of where our three leading engineering candidates stand:

• Tom Davis – 10+ years of software-development experience with prior roles at GlobalSoft and InnoTech. Completed initial and technical interviews; reference checks are now underway.

• Susan Lee – Holds a master’s degree in computer science and has five years of AI/ML experience at FastTech. Finished her technical interview last week and is scheduled for a final-round conversation with the broader team.

• Raj Patel – Senior engineer with roughly a decade in cybersecurity, most recently at SecureTech. Performed well in the technical assessment and we are currently reviewing the full results; references have been requested.

Next steps/ETA:
• Reference feedback for Tom should arrive shortly.
• Susan’s final round is set for early next week; decisions soon after.
• Raj’s assessment review should conclude within a few days, pending reference responses.

Let me know if you need any additional details or wish to adjust the timeline.

Best,
Jane
