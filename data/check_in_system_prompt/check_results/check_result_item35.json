  "email_content": "Hi Alex,\n\nAs requested, here is the anonymized, portfolio-level customer engagement data pulled from my notes:\n\n\u2022 Customers aged 25\u201340 represent roughly 38% of our active user base, with a median monthly spend of about $2,800.\n\u2022 Mobile banking adoption is strongest among customers under 30, with approximately 72% using the mobile app for at least half of their transactions.\n\u2022 Mortgage and auto loans together account for about 45% of total loan balances.\n\u2022 Debit card usage has increased by roughly 18% over the past year, likely driven by greater contactless-payment adoption.\n\nAll figures are fully aggregated to maintain customer privacy. Let me know if you need any additional breakdowns or have other questions.\n\nBest regards,\nJane\nUnion Trust Bank",
