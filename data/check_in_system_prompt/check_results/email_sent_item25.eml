Hi Team,

I hope you’re doing well. I’d like to share a quick overview of a few upcoming changes to our office space and the way we work.

Office Environment
• Renovation of the ground floor will begin next week. During this period all common work areas and the break room on that floor will be refreshed. We’ll temporarily relocate to the upper floors, and signage will guide you to available desks and collaboration zones.
• We’re looking into stabilizing temperature settings across open areas and creating designated quiet zones to support focused work. Feel free to share additional suggestions.

Workflow Enhancements
• We’re rolling out AgileBoost, a lightweight framework that builds on our current agile practices. Key points:
  – Shorter, iterative cycles with clearly defined objectives.
  – Cross-functional collaboration encouraged at every stage.
  – Continuous feedback loops so teams can adapt quickly.

What’s Next
• A brief orientation on AgileBoost will be scheduled soon.
• Facilities will send a floor-plan update before renovation starts.

Please reach out if you have questions or ideas.

Thank you for your flexibility and support.

Best,
John
