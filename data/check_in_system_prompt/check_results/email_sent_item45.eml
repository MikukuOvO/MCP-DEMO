Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you very much for reaching out and for the kind invitation to contribute to Vital Voices. I appreciate the opportunity to share my story and help advance the conversation around HIV awareness and destigmatization.

I would be delighted to take part—whether through an interview, a guest article, or both. I have an outline from a recent advocacy talk that covers key points such as early testing, challenging stigma, and the importance of treatment and support systems. I can adapt these insights into an article of whatever length you prefer, or use them as a framework for an interview discussion.

Please let me know which format and timeline work best on your end, as well as any word-count guidelines or suggested angles you’d like me to emphasize. I’m flexible over the coming weeks and can schedule a conversation or submit a draft at your convenience.

Thank you again for considering my voice for Vital Voices. I look forward to collaborating and will gladly provide any additional background material you may need.

Warm regards,
Jane
