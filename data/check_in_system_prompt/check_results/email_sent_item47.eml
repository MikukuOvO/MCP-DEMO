Hi Justice for All Legal Aid Team,

Thank you for offering your support to our neighbors.

Below are a few introductions and resource leads that I believe would benefit from your pro-bono immigration services:

1. Carlos — A long-time community member who recently approached me looking for immigration guidance. I have let him know about your program and he is eager to connect. Please let me know the best next step and I will facilitate an introduction.

2. Community Welcome Center – Immigrant Support Desk  
   • Program Coordinator: Maria L.  
   • Focus: First-step screenings and referrals for recent arrivals.

3. City Community Law Clinic  
   • Offers weekly walk-in hours for low-income residents seeking immigration advice.

4. Neighborhood Legal Collective  
   • Volunteer attorneys who specialize in family-based petitions and humanitarian relief.

5. Downtown Immigrant Resource Hub  
   • Hosts monthly "Know Your Rights" workshops and can help identify additional clients who may need representation.

I also maintain a broader directory of local clinics, nonprofit partners, and volunteer attorneys. If helpful, I can share that list or arrange a short call to discuss collaboration opportunities.

Please let me know how you’d like to proceed with Carlos’ introduction and whether any of the resources above would be useful for your outreach.

Thank you again for the vital work you do.

Warm regards,
Jane
