Dear Mrs. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out. Below is a concise summary of Timmy’s current health status for your records:

• Asthma: Timmy’s asthma is well controlled at this time. We have made a minor adjustment to his daily controller inhaler. Please ensure his rescue inhaler remains readily available at school, and continue to follow the Asthma Action Plan we have on file. No changes to his activity level are required.

• Recent Illness: Timmy has fully recovered from the respiratory infection he experienced earlier this season and is cleared for all regular school activities.

I will send an updated, signed Asthma Action Plan and medication authorization form via secure fax for your files. If you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to let me know.

Warm regards,

Dr. Jane
Pediatrician, Happy Valley Children’s Clinic
