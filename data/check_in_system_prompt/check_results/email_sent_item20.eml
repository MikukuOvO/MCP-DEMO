• Product Pioneers in Action – Work is already progressing on the next generation of our flagship products. More details will be revealed at the next company all-hands meeting.

• Team-Building on the Horizon – Get ready for some exciting activities, including a company-wide hackathon and a virtual-reality exploration challenge. Dates and sign-up details will be announced soon.

• Welcoming New Team Members – Please join us in giving a warm welcome to the talented colleagues who will be starting next week. Our Talent Acquisition Team has prepared an onboarding program to help them settle in smoothly.
