Hi Mark,

Thanks for following up.

At this time, the only company-wide initiatives that have been officially communicated are our regular employee-development programsâ€”for example, the next TeamBoost Workshop, which is scheduled for late February and will be held virtually. These workshops are designed to strengthen collaboration and productivity and are part of our ongoing professional-development calendar.

Beyond these announced programs, there have been no new public statements about organizational or structural changes. If any updates are formally released, the HR team will share them with everyone at the same time.

I hope this clarifies things. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Best regards,
Jane
