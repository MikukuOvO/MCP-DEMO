Hello Rainbow Fertility Care team,

Thank you for sending over the checklist for our first appointment. Below is the information you requested so we can set up an initial consultation:

1. Contact information
   • Jane (she/her) – you can reach us through this email address.
   • Alex (she/her)

2. Preferred consultation timing
   • We are available on weekdays in mid-March or, if easier, in early April.

3. Relevant background
   • We are preparing for our first child and would like to discuss assisted-reproduction options such as IUI and IVF.
   • There is a family history of multiple births on Alex’s side, which we understand may be relevant.
   • Our personal physician, Dr. Emily Harris, has advised a personalized care plan.

4. Topics & questions we hope to cover
   • Comparative success rates of IUI versus IVF in similar cases
   • Legal considerations we should be aware of
   • Any lifestyle or dietary recommendations before treatment

Please let us know the next steps and your earliest weekday slots that align with the timeframes above. We look forward to working with your team.

Warm regards,
Jane & Alex
