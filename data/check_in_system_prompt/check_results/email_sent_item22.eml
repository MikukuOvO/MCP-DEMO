Dear Mark,

Thank you for reaching out. Below is a concise, jurisdiction-agnostic overview of motion-filing best practices that I have found useful. I’ve kept the points broad so they can be adapted to most forums.

1. Confirm governing rules early
   • Review the court’s civil procedure rules and any standing orders for the assigned judge.
   • Pay special attention to notice periods, page limits, and requirements for supporting documents.

2. Calendar all deadlines
   • Work backward from the desired hearing date, accounting for notice, opposition, and reply periods.
   • Build in buffer time for service problems or unexpected revisions.

3. Meet and confer where required (and where practical even if not required)
   • A brief, well-documented meet-and-confer can narrow issues and strengthen a later request for fees or sanctions if the opposition proves unreasonable.

4. Craft a clear opening section
   • Begin with a succinct statement of the relief sought and the primary legal grounds—judges appreciate knowing exactly what you want and why within the first page.

5. Support the motion factually
   • Use declarations or affidavits to present key facts rather than embedding them in the memorandum.
   • Cite record evidence or attach relevant exhibits so the court can verify assertions quickly.

6. Observe formatting and courtesy requirements
   • Follow local formatting rules (font, citations, proposed order, bookmarks). 
   • Deliver courtesy copies if the judge or clerk’s office requests them.

7. Proof of service and proposed order
   • File proof of service promptly and attach a proposed order that tracks the requested relief.
   • Providing the order in editable format can expedite a ruling.

8. Prepare for the hearing
   • Outline anticipated questions and have pinpoint references ready.
   • If oral argument is waived, consider a short supplemental brief to address new authority or developments.

I hope these pointers help. Let me know if you’d like to discuss any of them in more detail or compare approaches in a specific jurisdiction.

Best regards,
Jane
