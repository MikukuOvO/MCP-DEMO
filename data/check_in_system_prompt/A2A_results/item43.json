Below is an overview that should give you a solid starting point. Let me know if anything needs more detail and I\u2019ll be happy to follow up.\\n\\n1. General Rhythm\\n\u2022 Ethan does best with a predictable day. He usually wakes early, has a calm morning routine that includes breakfast and light movement, spends mid-morning on brain-teaser activities, and enjoys lunch in the early afternoon. The later part of the afternoon is set aside for quiet interests or appointments, followed by dinner in the early evening, a favorite nature programme, and an early, consistent bedtime.\\n\\n2. Interests & Motivators\\n\u2022 Puzzle games, especially jigsaws and logic puzzles.\\n\u2022 Anything related to animals\u2014visits to a zoo or watching animal documentaries are big hits.\\n\u2022 Water play and swimming lessons.\\n\u2022 Drawing and painting; he keeps a small art kit handy.\\n\u2022 Simple, familiar foods (oatmeal, fruit, uncomplicated sandwiches) work well.\\n\\n3. Communication & Interaction\\n\u2022 He responds best to clear, direct language and appreciates having two simple choices rather than open-ended questions.\\n\u2022 Visual cues (picture cards or a short written list) help him understand what is coming next.\\n\u2022 If he starts to look unsettled\u2014checking the door, rubbing his hands, or going quiet\u2014it\u2019s usually his way of signaling that he needs a short break somewhere calm. A quick reset in a quieter spot works wonders.\\n\u2022 Positive reinforcement (\u201cGreat job finishing the puzzle!\u201d) motivates him more than verbal corrections.\\n\\n4. Environmental Tips\\n\u2022 Give a gentle heads-up before transitions such as leaving the house or finishing an activity.\\n\u2022 Keep background noise and strong smells low when possible.\\n\u2022 Consistency is key\u2014using the same phrases and order of activities helps him feel secure.\\n\\n5. Additional Resources\\nI keep brief notes in my workspace on his daily rhythm, favorite activities, and strategies that work well. If you\u2019d like access, just let me know and I can share view-only links.\\n\\nI hope this helps you feel prepared for your first sessions with Ethan. Thanks again for your willingness to work with him\u2014he\u2019ll benefit from your support, and we really appreciate it.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nJane\"}"
