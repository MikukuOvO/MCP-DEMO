Feel free to pick one or two that resonate most and build from there.\n\n1. Mindfulness Micro-Breaks\n   \u2022 Spend 2\u20135 minutes a few times a day simply noticing your breath or your surroundings.\n   \u2022 A simple practice: inhale for a count of 4, hold for 2, exhale for 6. Repeat for 5 rounds.\n\n2. Deep Breathing (4-7-8 Method)\n   \u2022 Inhale quietly through the nose for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale audibly through the mouth for 8.\n   \u2022 Do 4 cycles when you wake up, before bed, or anytime you feel tension building.\n\n3. Progressive Muscle Relaxation\n   \u2022 Working from your feet up, tense each muscle group for 5\u20137 seconds and then release for 15\u201320 seconds.\n   \u2022 This helps reduce physical tension and brings awareness to areas you might be \u201cholding\u201d stress.\n\n4. Daily Movement\n   \u2022 Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate activity (walking, cycling, stretching) most days.\n   \u2022 Movement increases endorphins and improves focus throughout the day.\n\n5. Sleep Hygiene Basics\n   \u2022 Keep a consistent sleep/wake schedule\u2014even on weekends.\n   \u2022 Power down screens 30\u201360 minutes before bed; dim lights to cue your body that it\u2019s time to wind down.\n   \u2022 Limit caffeine after 2 p.m. and keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet.\n\n6. Balanced Nutrition & Hydration\n   \u2022 Try to include a source of protein, complex carbs, and colorful produce at each meal.\n   \u2022 Keep a reusable water bottle nearby; mild dehydration can mimic fatigue and low mood.\n\n7. Journaling & Gratitude\n   \u2022 Spend 5 minutes noting three things that went well each day or things you\u2019re grateful for.\n   \u2022 This practice can shift attention toward positive experiences and build emotional resilience.\n\n8. Social Connection\n   \u2022 Schedule regular check-ins (in person or virtual) with supportive friends or family.\n   \u2022 Even brief positive interactions can boost mood and buffer stress.\n\nGetting Started\n\u2022 Choose one or two practices this week and experiment with the timing and frequency that fits your schedule.\n\u2022 Use reminders (phone alarms, sticky notes) until new habits feel more natural.\n\nIf you have any questions or want to dive deeper into any of these strategies, let me know and we can discuss them during our next session.\n\nTake care,\nJane\n\nJane Doe, LCSW\nNewbridge Therapy Practice\n(555) 123-4567 | jane@newbridge-therapy.com\n\nDisclaimer: The information above is for general wellness purposes and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.
