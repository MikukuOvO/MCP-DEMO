Hi Alex,

Thank you for reaching out.

Based on my market research, eight years of development experience (including three years at TechSolutions), and the scope of responsibilities we discussed, I believe a total annual cash compensation in the range of $150,000 – $165,000 is appropriate for the Lead Developer role. This range assumes a base salary of approximately $140,000 – $155,000 with the remainder in performance-based bonus or equity.

I’m, of course, open to discussing the overall compensation package (benefits, equity, growth opportunities, etc.) to find a mutually beneficial arrangement.

Please let me know if you need any additional information. I look forward to the next steps.

Best regards,
John
