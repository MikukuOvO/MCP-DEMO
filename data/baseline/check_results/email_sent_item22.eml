Hi Mark,

Great to hear from you. Below is a concise, purely general overview of the motion-filing procedure that I keep in my reference notes.  I’ve stripped out anything client-specific so you can use it freely or adapt it to your own firm’s templates.

1. Preliminary Checks
   • Confirm subject-matter and personal jurisdiction.
   • Identify the controlling procedural rule (e.g., State R. Civ. P. 7, 12, 56, etc.) and any local-court standing orders.
   • Verify timing triggers (days are often counted under the “next business-day” rule; watch for holidays).

2. Core Components of a Motion Packet
   • Notice of Motion – captioned, with hearing date/time left blank unless court assigns one.
   • Memorandum of Law – typically limited to 20–25 pages; include table of authorities when >10 pages.
   • Affidavit/Declaration – facts outside the pleadings, signed and notarised where required.
   • Exhibits – clearly tabbed/labelled; provide courtesy copies for bulky records.
   • Proposed Order – many judges expect a Word or editable PDF version to be e-mailed after e-filing.

3. Formatting & Technical Must-Dos
   • Use required font (often 12-pt Times New Roman) and 1-inch margins.
   • Consecutive pagination across the entire filing (including exhibits, unless local rule says otherwise).
   • Blue-back or coloured covers have largely disappeared, but some counties still require them for paper courtesy copies.

4. Filing Steps (State-Court E-filing)
   a. Create the electronic envelope; upload each document as a separate PDF.
   b. Pay the motion fee (if applicable) before final submission—otherwise the clerk’s office rejects the packet.
   c. Obtain the stamped “Filed” confirmation page; save it—service is not complete without it in some jurisdictions.

5. Service & Courtesy Copies
   • Serve all parties the same day the motion is accepted by the clerk (email + first-class mail is typical).
   • File the Certificate/Proof of Service within 1 business day, unless combined in the main filing.
   • Check if the judge requires a bound courtesy copy within 5 days; deliver to chambers with the e-filing receipt.

6. Hearing & Follow-Up
   • Many state courts set hearing dates automatically; if not, you must obtain a date from the clerk before filing.
   • Keep an eye on case-management orders that may supersede default briefing schedules.
   • After the ruling, calendar any deadlines that the order triggers (e.g., amended pleading deadlines or appeal clocks).

Common Pitfalls to Avoid
• Missing word- or page-count limits when combining multiple motions.
• Forgetting to include a proposed order—several clerks will reject the entire packet.
• Leaving exhibits unsecured (PDFs over 25 MB may fail to upload—break them into parts).

Reference Note
The above is distilled from my internal “Motion Filing Procedures” checklist (May 2025 update).  Feel free to treat it as a starting framework—always double-check your venue’s local rules.

Hope this is helpful, and let me know if you need anything else.

Best,
Jane
