Dear Dr. Strauss,

As requested, please find below the aggregated prevalence figures for the genetic markers observed among the population I counsel. These figures are derived from de-identified, aggregate-level data only.

â€¢ BRCA1 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants: 5 % of tested individuals in the cohort (no individual-level data are included).

At present, this is the only marker for which a complete, statistically meaningful aggregate has been compiled across my practice records. I am continuing to aggregate data for additional markers (e.g., BRCA2, TP53, MTHFR) and will forward those figures as soon as they are finalized.

Please let me know if you need the information in another format or if any further clarification would be helpful.

Best regards,
Jane Doe, MS, CGC
Genetic Counselor
