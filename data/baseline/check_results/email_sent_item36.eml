Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out. I’m happy to share what’s officially confirmed and appropriate for open distribution.

• The only upcoming initiative that may be sparking chatter is the roll-out of our TeamBoost Workshops, scheduled to begin next month. These half-day sessions focus on practical tools for collaboration and efficiency and will be offered to all teams over the next two quarters.
• There are no announced restructuring plans, reductions, or changes to roles associated with the workshops.
• Leadership reiterated at the last All-Hands that these workshops are part of our ongoing investment in professional development, not a signal of any broader organizational shift.

If any additional, shareable information becomes available, I’ll let you know promptly. In the meantime, please feel free to pass this along to your team.

Hope this helps put minds at ease.

Best regards,
Jane
Human Resources
