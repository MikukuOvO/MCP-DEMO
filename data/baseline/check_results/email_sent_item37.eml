Hi Sarah,

Thanks for looping me in. I reviewed the recent culture-feedback notes and the performance evaluations, and a few common themes came through: the team is eager for more creative problem-solving opportunities, open cross-functional communication, and strategic “big-picture” thinking. With that in mind, here are some ideas for the retreat:

1. Innovation Hackathon (½-day)
   • Small, cross-disciplinary teams work on a passion project or pain point outside their day-to-day scope.
   • Culminates in quick demos and peer voting. Provides the “platform for sharing innovative ideas” that people asked for in the culture survey.

2. Strategy Sandbox Workshop (2 hrs)
   • Scenario-planning exercise where groups respond to a sudden market shift and pitch their approach.
   • Builds on the adaptability strengths we saw in reviews (e.g., Mark’s strategic thinking) while sharpening big-picture alignment.

3. Communication Lab Role-Play (90 min)
   • Guided by an external facilitator or our L&D lead.
   • Participants practice delivering complex updates to other departments and receive feedback. This targets the inter-departmental communication gaps highlighted in several evaluations.

4. Team-Bonding “Escape the Code” Challenge (Fun Evening Activity)
   • Tech-themed escape-room style puzzle that requires collaboration across job functions.

5. Wellness & Reflection Blocks
   • Morning mindfulness or gentle hike to keep everyone energised.
   • End-of-day fireside chat where people share take-aways and give kudos.

Logistics & Misc.
• 2.5 days has worked well for us in the past—enough time to dive deep without tying everyone up for a full week.
• A venue with flexible indoor spaces (for hackathon/workshops) plus outdoor areas (for wellness activities) would be ideal.
• If budget allows, consider recording hackathon demos so teams can continue iterating post-retreat.

I’m happy to flesh out agendas or coordinate facilitators—just let me know how I can help.

Best,
John
