Hi Lisa,

Thank you for your willingness to get to know Ethan before you start working with him. I reviewed my notes and pulled together the highlights that tend to make the biggest difference in his day-to-day comfort and success.

1. Structure & Routine
• Ethan feels safest when the day follows a predictable pattern.  A typical weekday looks like this:
   – 7:00 AM  Wake-up and personal care
   – 7:30 AM  Breakfast (oatmeal with sliced banana)
   – 10:00-11:00 AM  Puzzle time – his favourite independent activity
   – 12:30 PM  Lunch (simple sandwich, usually turkey or PB&J)
   – 1:00-3:00 PM  Quiet reading or music
   – 3:00 PM  Behavioural-therapy session
   – 6:00 PM  Dinner (warm, soft-texture foods preferred)
   – 7:00 PM  Nature documentary or animal-themed show
   – 8:30 PM  Bedtime
• Visual schedules or a quick verbal preview of “what’s next” help him transition smoothly.

2. Sensory Considerations
• Food: Warm temperature and soft–medium textures work best. He typically refuses salads or very cold items.
• Environment: He is sensitive to loud, sudden noises—especially while eating. A quiet, calmly lit space keeps him regulated.
• Overload cues: Covering ears, rocking, or pacing signal that he needs a break. Offering a quiet corner or headphones usually helps.

3. Motivators & Preferred Activities
• Animals (trips to the zoo, documentaries)
• Water play and learning to swim (always with close supervision)
• Puzzles (jigsaws) – daily
• Creative arts: drawing and painting; he has his own supplies

4. Communication & Current Therapy Goals
• Recent progress: He’s begun verbally asking for a break when overwhelmed and initiating simple play with peers.
• Strategies that work: Calm tone, concrete language, and positive reinforcement ("Great job letting me know you needed quiet time").
• Prompting hierarchy: verbal prompt → visual prompt → gentle physical prompt only if needed.

5. Snacks & Meals
• Favourite snacks: apple slices with peanut butter; crackers with cheese.
• Drinks: prefers water or warm herbal tea; avoids anything fizzy.

6. Safety & Supervision Notes
• Water activities require arm’s-length supervision even in shallow areas.
• When out in public, hand-under-hand guidance can prevent wandering without feeling restrictive.

I’m happy to share the full Notion pages if you’d like more detail, but the points above should give you a solid starting framework.  Let me know if any questions come up or if you’d like to talk through specific scenarios.

Thanks again for partnering with us to support Ethan.

Best,
Jane
