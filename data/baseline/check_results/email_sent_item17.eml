Hi MedTech Solutions Team,

I hope you’re doing well. As we prepare for your next software release (currently slated for April 15, 2025), I wanted to share Greenleaf Health Center’s key needs and considerations so that we can ensure a smooth transition for both our staff and patients.

1. Downtime & Scheduling
•  Preferred maintenance window: Friday 10:00 p.m.–12:00 a.m. ET (or another late-evening, low-volume slot)
•  Please provide at least 48-hours advance notice of any planned outage and a real-time status page link.

2. Data Security & Compliance
•  Confirmation that all PHI remains encrypted in transit and at rest post-upgrade
•  Full system backup immediately before the upgrade with a rapid rollback option if needed
•  Updated HIPAA compliance summary or attestation for our records

3. New Feature Enablement
•  Wait-list/standby scheduling so cancelled slots can be auto-offered to patients
•  Bulk SMS reminders directly through the scheduling interface (Twilio or native gateway)
•  Enhanced reporting: ability to schedule recurring PDF/CSV exports of daily appointment lists and monthly KPI dashboards
•  Expanded role-based permissions and detailed audit logs for user activity

4. Training & Documentation
•  30-minute onboarding webinar for front-desk staff plus short video tutorials
•  Quick-start guide (1–2 pages) highlighting any workflow changes
•  Access to a sandbox/demo environment at least one week prior to go-live so we can test new features with mock data

5. Post-Release Support
•  Dedicated contact (or ticket queue) for the first two business days after launch
•  Expected first-response and resolution SLAs during this hyper-care period

These points are based on internal discussions and notes in our workspace (“Upcoming Software Update – MedTech Solutions,” 16 May 2025). Please review and let me know if anything requires clarification, or if additional information would be helpful for your team.

Thank you for your partnership, and we look forward to the new capabilities.

Best regards,
