Preliminary Validation (Day 0-2)\n    \u2022  Specialist reviews basic eligibility (transaction posted, customer authority, timely filing, supporting documents).  If something is missing, the customer is contacted immediately.\n\n4.  Investigation Phase (Typical Day 2-20)\n    \u2022  Evidence gathering: transaction logs, fraud monitoring notes, merchant descriptors, customer-supplied receipts, screenshots, photos, communications, police report if applicable.\n    \u2022  Provisional credit: For deposit accounts we issue provisional credit within 10 business days when investigation exceeds that window.  Credit-card customers are not required to pay the amount while the claim is open.\n\n5.  Merchant Engagement (Day 3-25)\n    \u2022  We forward the claim to the acquiring bank/merchant via the Visa/Mastercard chargeback network, requesting documentary proof of purchase or service delivery.\n    \u2022  Merchant has up to 15 calendar days (domestic) or 30 days (cross-border) to respond.\n\n6.  Decision & Customer Notification (Typical Day 10-30)\n    \u2022  If evidence supports the customer, a chargeback/refund is processed the same day and the customer is informed by phone and e-mail.\n    \u2022  If the merchant\u2019s evidence is persuasive, the claim is declined with a full written explanation and copies of documentation.\n\n7.  Appeal / Escalation\n    \u2022  Customers may request a second-look review within 14 days of an adverse decision.\n    \u2022  After the internal appeal, unresolved matters can be escalated to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) or the state banking ombudsman.
