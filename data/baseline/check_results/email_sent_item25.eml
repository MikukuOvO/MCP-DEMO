Hi Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. I’d like to bring you up to speed on a few important items that affect us all.

1. Office Environment – Renovation & Temporary Moves
• The ground-floor renovation starts next week. Work will focus on the common work areas and the break room.
• During this period, all teams that normally sit on the ground floor will be temporarily relocated to designated spaces on the upper floors. Seating charts will be posted later today.
• Facilities will keep an eye on temperature settings and has agreed to pilot designated "quiet hours" to help control noise while we’re in closer quarters. Please send any additional comfort or workspace suggestions my way.

2. Company-Wide Workflow Changes – AgileBoost Roll-out
• We are launching the AgileBoost workflow to streamline project delivery and cross-team collaboration.
   – Phase 1: System configuration & tool integrations (kicks off next Monday)
   – Phase 2: Department-level workflow customization + user-acceptance testing
   – Phase 3: Team onboarding & training sessions
• Go-Live is targeted for the end of next month. Training invites and reference docs will land in your calendars/inboxes shortly. Your project managers will coordinate any early-access needs.

3. Major Project Highlights
• Project Phoenix is tracking ahead of schedule following the last sprint—great work, everyone involved!
• Project Quantum is experiencing some technical challenges. A catch-up plan is underway, and we’ll keep you posted on progress and support requests.

Key Takeaways / Action Items
• Review the temporary seating plan when published and let Facilities know if you have special requirements.
• Forward any questions about AgileBoost phases or training to your project manager or me.
• Keep communication channels open so we can smooth out any bumps as renovation and workflow changes progress.

Thank you for your flexibility and continued commitment. Together we’ll keep momentum strong while making our workspace and processes even better.

Best regards,
John
Team Lead, InnoSoft Solutions
