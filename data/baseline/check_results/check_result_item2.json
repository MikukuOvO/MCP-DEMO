  "email_content": "Hi Emily,\n\nGreat to hear from you\u2014thanks for reaching out. Below is a concise framework I rely on when working with clients who present with generalized anxiety, panic disorder, or mixed-feature anxiety. I pulled most of this from the CBT protocols and treatment notes in my Notion workspace (see the pages \u201cCognitive-Behavioral Techniques for Anxiety\u201d and \u201cRecommended Reading on Anxiety Disorders\u201d). Feel free to adapt any element to fit your style and the policies at Greenleaf.\n\n1. Thorough Assessment & Case Formulation\n\u2022 Use a structured clinical interview + rating scales (GAD-7, BAI, PDSS) to clarify diagnosis and severity.\n\u2022 Map out pre-disposing, precipitating, perpetuating, and protective factors so you have a clear CBT formulation to guide treatment.\n\n2. Psychoeducation & Normalisation\n\u2022 Explain the fight/flight response, the role of avoidance, and how anxious thoughts, physical sensations, and behaviours interact.\n\u2022 Reassure clients that anxiety is common and treatable; this alone often reduces distress.\n\n3. Core CBT Interventions\n\u2022 Cognitive restructuring: Identify automatic thoughts, challenge cognitive distortions, and generate balanced alternatives.\n\u2022 Exposure therapy: Build a graded exposure hierarchy (in-vivo and interoceptive) and work through it systematically. Pair with response-prevention so safety behaviours fade.\n\u2022 Behavioural experiments: Test feared predictions in session and for homework to collect disconfirming evidence.\n\u2022 Skills training: Diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, 4-7-8 breathing, and guided imagery.\n\n4. Mindfulness & Acceptance Elements\n\u2022 Brief mindfulness exercises can reduce rumination and worry; 5-minute breathing space or body-scan recordings work well.\n\u2022 Encourage non-judgemental awareness of bodily sensations during exposure tasks.\n\n5. Coping Toolkit & Relapse Prevention\n\u2022 Develop a written coping card that lists grounding strategies, crisis numbers, and supportive contacts.\n\u2022 In final sessions, rehearse setbacks and how the client will respond; schedule booster sessions if feasible.\n\n6. Collaboration & Medication\n\u2022 For moderate-to-severe presentations, liaise with a physician or psychiatrist regarding SSRIs or SNRIs.\n\u2022 Monitor side-effects and reinforce that medication enhances\u2014but does not replace\u2014skills practice.\n\n7. Progress Monitoring\n\u2022 Re-administer GAD-7 or BAI every 3\u20134 sessions.\n\u2022 Graph scores with the client so they can see objective improvement.\n\nRecommended Resources (from my Notion page)\n\u2022 \"The Anxiety and Worry Workbook\" \u2013 Clark & Beck\n\u2022 \"Mind Over Mood\" (2nd ed.) \u2013 Greenberger & Padesky\n\u2022 \"Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: Mastery\" \u2013 James\n\u2022 Any of David Barlow\u2019s work on exposure-based CBT\n\nIf you need full copies of the Notion pages or example worksheets (thought records, exposure hierarchy templates, etc.), just let me know and I\u2019ll share them directly.\n\nHope this is useful! Happy to chat through a specific case whenever you\u2019d like.\n\nWarm regards,\nJohn\nLicensed Therapist",
