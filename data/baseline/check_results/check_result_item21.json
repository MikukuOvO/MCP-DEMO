I\u2019ve completed a thorough review and wanted to share my feedback with you.\n\nOverall assessment\n-----------------\nGrade: B+\n\nWhat you did well\n\u2022 Solid grasp of the core course concepts and literature.\n\u2022 Your data analysis was carefully executed and the visualizations effectively supported your argument.\n\u2022 The final paper was clearly structured, making it easy to follow your line of reasoning.\n\nAreas to strengthen\n\u2022 Hypothesis statement \u2013 try condensing it into one or two precise sentences to sharpen the focus of the paper.\n\u2022 Research question \u2013 make sure it aligns perfectly with the hypothesis so readers immediately see the connection.\n\u2022 Discussion \u2013 consider adding a brief reflection on limitations and potential future directions.\n\nNext steps\nIf you would like to revise the project (for possible conference submission or your portfolio), I recommend beginning with a tighter hypothesis and then revisiting your discussion section. Feel free to drop by my office hours next week, or email me to set up another time, if you\u2019d like to talk through any of these points in more detail.\n\nThank you again for your hard work on this project.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJane \nProfessor, [Department]\n",
