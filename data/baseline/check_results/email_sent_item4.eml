Hi Sarah,

I’ve reviewed our records for Jane Smith and cross-checked the HealFast eligibility criteria in my workspace.

Summary of findings
• Path to Wellness Participation: Jane enrolled on 2 Oct 2024 and completed the required six-month period on 1 Apr 2025.
• Documented Progress: Consultation notes (last updated 16 May 2025) show:
   – Lower-back pain: ~40 % reduction in pain intensity with improved range of motion after PT and ergonomic changes.
   – Migraines: Frequency reduced from ~2/week to about 1/month following preventive medication and trigger-avoidance strategies.
   – Joint stiffness: Mild improvement with NSAIDs and low-impact exercise; re-evaluation scheduled in three months.
• No contraindications or outstanding compliance issues were found.

Conclusion
Jane Smith meets the HealFast Program requirements (≥6 months in Path to Wellness with demonstrable health gains). I therefore recommend her for enrollment.

Next steps
I will complete and submit the official HealFast enrollment form in the provider portal by the end of this week. Please let me know if your team needs any additional information or documentation.

Thank you, and feel free to reach out with any questions.
