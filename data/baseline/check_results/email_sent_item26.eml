Hi Angela,

Here’s a brief status snapshot of the Zenith Wellness Program as of mid-May:

Participation & Engagement
• Overall enrollment has climbed to 78% of employees, continuing the steady month-to-month rise we’ve seen since the January launch.
• The most frequently used resources are the partner-gym memberships, individual nutrition-planning sessions, and the weekly stress-management workshops.
• Pulse-check surveys indicate high satisfaction with the program content and scheduling flexibility.

Early Outcomes
• Aggregate biometric screenings (opt-in) are beginning to show modest improvements in weight management and blood-pressure control among participants.
• One notable success story: a participant has achieved a 10% weight reduction alongside better-regulated blood pressure through consistent engagement with coaching and fitness resources.

Next Steps (May–June)
• Finalizing a company-wide “Walk-at-Work” step challenge slated for early June to keep momentum high.
• Expanding the stress-management workshop series to accommodate the larger participant base.
• Preparing a more detailed Q2 report—including ROI indicators—targeted for leadership review by 10 June.

All related metrics, survey results, and resource links have just been updated in the Notion workspace (Zenith Wellness Initiative → Overview) for your review.

Please let me know if you’d like any further detail or a deeper dive into specific metrics.

Best regards,
John
Health Program Coordinator
