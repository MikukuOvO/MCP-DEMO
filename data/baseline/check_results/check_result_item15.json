These figures are derived from de-identified, aggregate-level data only.\n\n\u2022 BRCA1 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants: 5 % of tested individuals in the cohort (no individual-level data are included).\n\nAt present, this is the only marker for which a complete, statistically meaningful aggregate has been compiled across my practice records. I am continuing to aggregate data for additional markers (e.g., BRCA2, TP53, MTHFR) and will forward those figures as soon as they are finalized.\n\nPlease let me know if you need the information in another format or if any further clarification would be helpful.\n\nBest regards,\nJane Doe, MS, CGC\nGenetic Counselor",
