Hi Sarah,

Here’s a concise status update on Project Falcon:

• Current Phase: Implementation (Phase 2)
• Progress to Date:
  – New marketing materials have been produced and shared with our test groups.
  – Early feedback has been very positive, indicating strong resonance with the target audience.
• Next Steps:
  – Review the social-media tweaks you suggested and incorporate them where appropriate.
  – Finalize the full asset package for the wider rollout.
• Timeline:
  – We remain on track to wrap up Phase 2 by the end of next week and transition into Phase 3 (review and optimization) immediately after.
• Risks / Needs:
  – No material blockers at this time; we’ll keep monitoring test-group feedback for any adjustments.

Let me know if you’d like a deeper dive or additional details.

Thanks,
John
