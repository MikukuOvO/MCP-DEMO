Office Environment \u2013 Renovation & Temporary Moves\n\u2022 The ground-floor renovation starts next week. Work will focus on the common work areas and the break room.\n\u2022 During this period, all teams that normally sit on the ground floor will be temporarily relocated to designated spaces on the upper floors. Seating charts will be posted later today.\n\u2022 Facilities will keep an eye on temperature settings and has agreed to pilot designated \"quiet hours\" to help control noise while we\u2019re in closer quarters. Please send any additional comfort or workspace suggestions my way.\n\n2. Company-Wide Workflow Changes \u2013 AgileBoost Roll-out\n\u2022 We are launching the AgileBoost workflow to streamline project delivery and cross-team collaboration.\n   \u2013 Phase 1: System configuration & tool integrations (kicks off next Monday)\n   \u2013 Phase 2: Department-level workflow customization + user-acceptance testing\n   \u2013 Phase 3: Team onboarding & training sessions\n\u2022 Go-Live is targeted for the end of next month. Training invites and reference docs will land in your calendars/inboxes shortly. Your project managers will coordinate any early-access needs.\n\n3. Major Project Highlights\n\u2022 Project Phoenix is tracking ahead of schedule following the last sprint\u2014great work, everyone involved!\n\u2022 Project Quantum is experiencing some technical challenges. A catch-up plan is underway, and we\u2019ll keep you posted on progress and support requests.\n\nKey Takeaways / Action Items\n\u2022 Review the temporary seating plan when published and let Facilities know if you have special requirements.\n\u2022 Forward any questions about AgileBoost phases or training to your project manager or me.\n\u2022 Keep communication channels open so we can smooth out any bumps as renovation and workflow changes progress.\n\nThank you for your flexibility and continued commitment.
