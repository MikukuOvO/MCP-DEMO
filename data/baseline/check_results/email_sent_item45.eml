Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you very much for reaching out and for inviting me to contribute to Vital Voices. I’m honored by the opportunity to share my story and help advance the conversation around HIV awareness and destigmatization.

I would be delighted to move forward. I’m comfortable with either (or both) an interview and a guest article—whichever best fits your editorial calendar. If helpful, we could begin with a recorded interview and then shape the key points into an article, but I’m flexible.

Availability for an interview:
• Monday–Thursday: 10:00 a.m.–2:00 p.m. EST
• Friday: 9:00 a.m.–12:00 p.m. EST

Please let me know if any of these windows work for you, or suggest alternatives.

If you’d prefer that I start with a written piece, I can provide a 1,200–1,500-word draft within two weeks of receiving your guidelines. Possible angles I have in mind include:
1. My personal journey from diagnosis to advocacy
2. Confronting stigma—stories and practical strategies
3. Navigating health care and treatment access
4. Mental-health resilience and community support

To ensure the piece meets your needs, could you kindly send over any editorial guidelines (tone, word count, formatting, audience demographics) as well as preferred deadlines or release forms?

I’m excited to collaborate and help amplify messages that empower and educate.

Warm regards,
