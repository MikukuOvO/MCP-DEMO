  "email_content": "Hi Lisa,\n\nThank you for your willingness to get to know Ethan before you start working with him. I reviewed my notes and pulled together the highlights that tend to make the biggest difference in his day-to-day comfort and success.\n\n1. Structure & Routine\n\u2022 Ethan feels safest when the day follows a predictable pattern.  A typical weekday looks like this:\n   \u2013 7:00 AM  Wake-up and personal care\n   \u2013 7:30 AM  Breakfast (oatmeal with sliced banana)\n   \u2013 10:00-11:00 AM  Puzzle time \u2013 his favourite independent activity\n   \u2013 12:30 PM  Lunch (simple sandwich, usually turkey or PB&J)\n   \u2013 1:00-3:00 PM  Quiet reading or music\n   \u2013 3:00 PM  Behavioural-therapy session\n   \u2013 6:00 PM  Dinner (warm, soft-texture foods preferred)\n   \u2013 7:00 PM  Nature documentary or animal-themed show\n   \u2013 8:30 PM  Bedtime\n\u2022 Visual schedules or a quick verbal preview of \u201cwhat\u2019s next\u201d help him transition smoothly.\n\n2. Sensory Considerations\n\u2022 Food: Warm temperature and soft\u2013medium textures work best. He typically refuses salads or very cold items.\n\u2022 Environment: He is sensitive to loud, sudden noises\u2014especially while eating. A quiet, calmly lit space keeps him regulated.\n\u2022 Overload cues: Covering ears, rocking, or pacing signal that he needs a break. Offering a quiet corner or headphones usually helps.\n\n3. Motivators & Preferred Activities\n\u2022 Animals (trips to the zoo, documentaries)\n\u2022 Water play and learning to swim (always with close supervision)\n\u2022 Puzzles (jigsaws) \u2013 daily\n\u2022 Creative arts: drawing and painting; he has his own supplies\n\n4. Communication & Current Therapy Goals\n\u2022 Recent progress: He\u2019s begun verbally asking for a break when overwhelmed and initiating simple play with peers.\n\u2022 Strategies that work: Calm tone, concrete language, and positive reinforcement (\"Great job letting me know you needed quiet time\").\n\u2022 Prompting hierarchy: verbal prompt \u2192 visual prompt \u2192 gentle physical prompt only if needed.\n\n5. Snacks & Meals\n\u2022 Favourite snacks: apple slices with peanut butter; crackers with cheese.\n\u2022 Drinks: prefers water or warm herbal tea; avoids anything fizzy.\n\n6. Safety & Supervision Notes\n\u2022 Water activities require arm\u2019s-length supervision even in shallow areas.\n\u2022 When out in public, hand-under-hand guidance can prevent wandering without feeling restrictive.\n\nI\u2019m happy to share the full Notion pages if you\u2019d like more detail, but the points above should give you a solid starting framework.  Let me know if any questions come up or if you\u2019d like to talk through specific scenarios.\n\nThanks again for partnering with us to support Ethan.\n\nBest,\nJane",
