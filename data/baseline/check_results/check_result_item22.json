  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nGreat to hear from you. Below is a concise, purely general overview of the motion-filing procedure that I keep in my reference notes.  I\u2019ve stripped out anything client-specific so you can use it freely or adapt it to your own firm\u2019s templates.\n\n1. Preliminary Checks\n   \u2022 Confirm subject-matter and personal jurisdiction.\n   \u2022 Identify the controlling procedural rule (e.g., State R. Civ. P. 7, 12, 56, etc.) and any local-court standing orders.\n   \u2022 Verify timing triggers (days are often counted under the \u201cnext business-day\u201d rule; watch for holidays).\n\n2. Core Components of a Motion Packet\n   \u2022 Notice of Motion \u2013 captioned, with hearing date/time left blank unless court assigns one.\n   \u2022 Memorandum of Law \u2013 typically limited to 20\u201325 pages; include table of authorities when >10 pages.\n   \u2022 Affidavit/Declaration \u2013 facts outside the pleadings, signed and notarised where required.\n   \u2022 Exhibits \u2013 clearly tabbed/labelled; provide courtesy copies for bulky records.\n   \u2022 Proposed Order \u2013 many judges expect a Word or editable PDF version to be e-mailed after e-filing.\n\n3. Formatting & Technical Must-Dos\n   \u2022 Use required font (often 12-pt Times New Roman) and 1-inch margins.\n   \u2022 Consecutive pagination across the entire filing (including exhibits, unless local rule says otherwise).\n   \u2022 Blue-back or coloured covers have largely disappeared, but some counties still require them for paper courtesy copies.\n\n4. Filing Steps (State-Court E-filing)\n   a. Create the electronic envelope; upload each document as a separate PDF.\n   b. Pay the motion fee (if applicable) before final submission\u2014otherwise the clerk\u2019s office rejects the packet.\n   c. Obtain the stamped \u201cFiled\u201d confirmation page; save it\u2014service is not complete without it in some jurisdictions.\n\n5. Service & Courtesy Copies\n   \u2022 Serve all parties the same day the motion is accepted by the clerk (email + first-class mail is typical).\n   \u2022 File the Certificate/Proof of Service within 1 business day, unless combined in the main filing.\n   \u2022 Check if the judge requires a bound courtesy copy within 5 days; deliver to chambers with the e-filing receipt.\n\n6. Hearing & Follow-Up\n   \u2022 Many state courts set hearing dates automatically; if not, you must obtain a date from the clerk before filing.\n   \u2022 Keep an eye on case-management orders that may supersede default briefing schedules.\n   \u2022 After the ruling, calendar any deadlines that the order triggers (e.g., amended pleading deadlines or appeal clocks).\n\nCommon Pitfalls to Avoid\n\u2022 Missing word- or page-count limits when combining multiple motions.\n\u2022 Forgetting to include a proposed order\u2014several clerks will reject the entire packet.\n\u2022 Leaving exhibits unsecured (PDFs over 25 MB may fail to upload\u2014break them into parts).\n\nReference Note\nThe above is distilled from my internal \u201cMotion Filing Procedures\u201d checklist (May 2025 update).  Feel free to treat it as a starting framework\u2014always double-check your venue\u2019s local rules.\n\nHope this is helpful, and let me know if you need anything else.\n\nBest,\nJane\n",
