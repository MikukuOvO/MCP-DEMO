Hi Selection Syndicate Team,

I’ve completed the latest review cycle and have updated all assessment pages in our Notion workspace. Below is a concise overview of each active candidate.  Full, detailed notes (interview feedback, technical-exercise results, scorecards, and recommended next steps) are available in the Notion database under “Candidate Assessments.”  Please let me know if you would like direct links to any specific page.

—  Michael Turner – Senior Backend Engineer (Round 2)
   • Technical Strengths: Python (advanced), Java (advanced), distributed-systems design, clear and structured problem-solving.
   • Cultural/Team Fit: Collaborative, methodical, enjoys mentoring junior devs.
   • Recommendation: Advance to final-round panel focused on systems-design depth and cross-team collaboration scenarios.
   • Note on Accommodations: Michael has disclosed a visual impairment that requires the use of screen-reader software.  Our interview platform is compatible, and similar support can be provided on the job.

—  (All other candidates have either accepted offers elsewhere or have been declined during the previous cycle; no new assessments are pending.)

Action Items
• Please review Michael’s profile and confirm availability for a final-round panel next week.
• Share any additional feedback or concerns before COB Friday so I can finalize scheduling.

Thanks, and let me know if you need anything further.

Best regards,
Jane
