Team Retreat Proposal

Proposal for an inclusive team retreat that ensures a comfortable and engaging experience for all team members at Bright Horizons Marketing Solutions. Activities are chosen to cater to a wide range of interests and include options for physical activities like hiking, creative endeavors such as painting classes, and strategic team-building exercises like trust-building workshops. Venue selection prioritizes accessibility for individuals with disabilities and offers a variety of dietary options to accommodate vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and kosher diets, ensuring no individual preferences or beliefs are singled out.

Please let me know if you would like me to expand on any of the sections or make additional edits before we circulate this to the broader team.

Best regards,
John
