Hi Sarah,

Thank you for your patience. I’ve reviewed the background deck you shared and pulled together the most relevant customer insights from our latest analytics at First Trust Bank. I hope the summary below helps guide the creative and targeting strategy.

1. Demographic Snapshot
• 18–34 ("Gen Z & Young Millennials") – 42 % of our active retail customer base; highest digital-only engagement (87 % log in exclusively via mobile). They over-index on contactless payments, P2P transfers, and budgeting tools.
• 35–49 ("Established Millennials/Gen X") – 31 %; strongest cross-product adoption (avg. 2.8 products vs. 1.9 overall). Mortgage refinancing and high-yield savings resonate most.
• 50+ ("Boomers+") – 27 %; branch-loyal segment, but digital adoption is accelerating (mobile log-ins up 19 % YoY). Security/reliability messaging tests best.

2. Product Adoption & Growth Areas (YoY)
• Mobile Wallet enrollments: ↑ 38 % (driven largely by 18–34 cohort)
• Cashback Credit Card activations: ↑ 24 % (strongest in 35–49 cohort)
• Credit-builder Secured Card: ↑ 52 % (new-to-credit & recent grads)
• Digital Auto-Save feature: ↑ 41 % usage, with 27 % setting recurring goals

3. Channel & Content Preferences
• Short-form video (≤15 sec) and interactive polls have the highest CTRs on Instagram & TikTok (4.6 % vs. 2.1 % benchmark).
• Email remains the most effective conversion channel for 35–49; best-performing subject lines emphasize tangible savings ("Earn up to $300 cash back this summer").
• For 50+, educational webinars (live or on-demand) drive a 2.3× lift in product inquiries compared with static blog content.

4. Pain Points & Motivators (Qual + NPS verbatims)
• 18–34: Want instant account opening, zero hidden fees, sustainability-aligned rewards.
• 35–49: Value personalized financial advice and frictionless switching/refi processes.
• 50+: Seek fraud protection, responsive customer support, and clear guidance on digital use.

5. Recommended Messaging Themes
• "Control & Transparency" – showcase in-app spend tracking and fee-free structure.
• "Growth Made Simple" – highlight automated savings and budgeting for life milestones.
• "Trusted Partner" – emphasize 24/7 fraud monitoring and personalized advisors.

Next Steps
If useful, I can provide deeper drill-downs (e.g., state-level data, audience look-alike models, or creative test results) as you solidify persona targets. Just let me know what will help your team the most.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions or additional data needs. Looking forward to collaborating on a standout campaign.

Best regards,
John
