Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out, and it’s great to virtually meet you!

I’m John, the newest member of Zenith Innovations. My background includes several industry-recognized certifications and hands-on experience coordinating cross-functional projects, which I’m excited to bring to our upcoming work together. I also stay active in the community through the Community Uplift Program and, outside of work, you can usually find me behind a camera lens or out on a hiking trail.

I’ve just reviewed the materials in our Notion workspace and have familiarized myself with the project background. Everything looks clear so far, and I’m looking forward to digging deeper and syncing up on priorities and next steps.

Please feel free to reach out anytime, and let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to prepare before our first project meeting.

Looking forward to collaborating!

Best regards,
John
Zenith Innovations
