Customer Snapshot: Growing E-Commerce Retailer
────────────────────────────────────
An e-commerce start-up (now a mid-size online retailer) transitioned to TelNet last year. They adopted a 1 Gbps fiber circuit and our hosted VoIP platform to handle heavy transaction traffic and customer support calls. Since migrating, their checkout latency dropped by 38 % and call-handling costs fell by 22 %. Just as importantly, their services scaled seamlessly during peak shopping seasons without additional downtime or re-configuration.

────────────────────────────────────
Next Steps
────────────────────────────────────
To prepare a tailored proposal, it would be helpful to know:
• Number of employees / voice seats
• Number of locations and any remote users
• Current and anticipated bandwidth requirements
• Desired implementation timeline

If it’s convenient, I can set up a brief call this week to discuss these details and answer any questions you may have.

Thank you again for considering TelNet Communications as your telecom partner. I look forward to the possibility of working together.

Warm regards,
