Hi Mark,

Hope planning is going well! Here’s what I was able to pull together from my notes and workspace:

Days Off
• Alex typically has Tuesdays and Thursdays off.  
• If his roster hasn’t changed, the next ones surrounding his birthday would be Tue Feb 27 & Thu Feb 29, then Tue Mar 4 & Thu Mar 6. (Worth confirming on the duty sheet, but those days rarely move.)

Home Address (for deliveries/drop-offs)
742 Evergreen Terrace

Preferences & Other Notes
• Gift idea he’s mentioned liking: a rugged smartwatch designed for first responders—GPS, heart-rate monitor, discreet notifications, the works.  
• Favorite snacks: anything salted-caramel (brownies, popcorn), spicy beef jerky, and dark-roast coffee beans.  
• Décor: He prefers clean, understated looks—navy/blues or silver accents over anything flashy or neon.  
• Timing: On his days off he’s usually home by ~18:00, so deliveries earlier in the afternoon keep the surprise intact.

Hope this helps. Let me know if there’s anything else you need and I’ll jump on it.

Cheers,
Jane
