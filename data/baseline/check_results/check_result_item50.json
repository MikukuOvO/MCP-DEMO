  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nHope planning is going well! Here\u2019s what I was able to pull together from my notes and workspace:\n\nDays Off\n\u2022 Alex typically has Tuesdays and Thursdays off.  \n\u2022 If his roster hasn\u2019t changed, the next ones surrounding his birthday would be Tue Feb 27 & Thu Feb 29, then Tue Mar 4 & Thu Mar 6. (Worth confirming on the duty sheet, but those days rarely move.)\n\nHome Address (for deliveries/drop-offs)\n742 Evergreen Terrace\n\nPreferences & Other Notes\n\u2022 Gift idea he\u2019s mentioned liking: a rugged smartwatch designed for first responders\u2014GPS, heart-rate monitor, discreet notifications, the works.  \n\u2022 Favorite snacks: anything salted-caramel (brownies, popcorn), spicy beef jerky, and dark-roast coffee beans.  \n\u2022 D\u00e9cor: He prefers clean, understated looks\u2014navy/blues or silver accents over anything flashy or neon.  \n\u2022 Timing: On his days off he\u2019s usually home by ~18:00, so deliveries earlier in the afternoon keep the surprise intact.\n\nHope this helps. Let me know if there\u2019s anything else you need and I\u2019ll jump on it.\n\nCheers,\nJane",
