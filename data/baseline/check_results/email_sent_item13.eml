Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. As promised, I’ve put together a short list of evidence-based wellness tips you can start integrating into your routine. Feel free to pick one or two that resonate most and build from there.

1. Mindfulness Micro-Breaks
   • Spend 2–5 minutes a few times a day simply noticing your breath or your surroundings.
   • A simple practice: inhale for a count of 4, hold for 2, exhale for 6. Repeat for 5 rounds.

2. Deep Breathing (4-7-8 Method)
   • Inhale quietly through the nose for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale audibly through the mouth for 8.
   • Do 4 cycles when you wake up, before bed, or anytime you feel tension building.

3. Progressive Muscle Relaxation
   • Working from your feet up, tense each muscle group for 5–7 seconds and then release for 15–20 seconds.
   • This helps reduce physical tension and brings awareness to areas you might be “holding” stress.

4. Daily Movement
   • Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate activity (walking, cycling, stretching) most days.
   • Movement increases endorphins and improves focus throughout the day.

5. Sleep Hygiene Basics
   • Keep a consistent sleep/wake schedule—even on weekends.
   • Power down screens 30–60 minutes before bed; dim lights to cue your body that it’s time to wind down.
   • Limit caffeine after 2 p.m. and keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet.

6. Balanced Nutrition & Hydration
   • Try to include a source of protein, complex carbs, and colorful produce at each meal.
   • Keep a reusable water bottle nearby; mild dehydration can mimic fatigue and low mood.

7. Journaling & Gratitude
   • Spend 5 minutes noting three things that went well each day or things you’re grateful for.
   • This practice can shift attention toward positive experiences and build emotional resilience.

8. Social Connection
   • Schedule regular check-ins (in person or virtual) with supportive friends or family.
   • Even brief positive interactions can boost mood and buffer stress.

Getting Started
• Choose one or two practices this week and experiment with the timing and frequency that fits your schedule.
• Use reminders (phone alarms, sticky notes) until new habits feel more natural.

If you have any questions or want to dive deeper into any of these strategies, let me know and we can discuss them during our next session.

Take care,
Jane
