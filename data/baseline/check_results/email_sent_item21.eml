Hi Alex,

Thank you for submitting your course project. I’ve completed a thorough review and wanted to share my feedback with you.

Overall assessment
-----------------
Grade: B+

What you did well
• Solid grasp of the core course concepts and literature.
• Your data analysis was carefully executed and the visualizations effectively supported your argument.
• The final paper was clearly structured, making it easy to follow your line of reasoning.

Areas to strengthen
• Hypothesis statement – try condensing it into one or two precise sentences to sharpen the focus of the paper.
• Research question – make sure it aligns perfectly with the hypothesis so readers immediately see the connection.
• Discussion – consider adding a brief reflection on limitations and potential future directions.

Next steps
If you would like to revise the project (for possible conference submission or your portfolio), I recommend beginning with a tighter hypothesis and then revisiting your discussion section. Feel free to drop by my office hours next week, or email me to set up another time, if you’d like to talk through any of these points in more detail.

Thank you again for your hard work on this project.

Best regards,

Jane 
Professor, [Department]
