Dear Mrs. Thompson,

Thank you for contacting me regarding Ethan. I have spoken with his mother, Mrs. Davis, and she is comfortable with my providing a brief update to help the school support him, as long as we avoid sharing detailed medical information in writing.

Current status
• Ethan is generally stable but is in the middle of a scheduled medication adjustment that has required several clinic visits and at-home monitoring.  
• The change in medication can temporarily cause increased fatigue, mild mood changes, and a greater susceptibility to common viral illnesses.  
• Because of these side-effects we recommended that he remain home on the days when his energy has been low or when he has had appointments for lab work and physical-therapy assessments.

Return-to-school timeline
Ethan plans to return early next week if he continues to tolerate the new regimen. Should anything change I will let you and his parents know right away.

School-based recommendations (please share with relevant staff only)
1. Allow flexible scheduling and extra time for class transitions and written assignments.  
2. Permit Ethan to keep a water bottle and a high-protein snack at his desk.  
3. Provide a quiet space (e.g., nurse’s office) where he can rest for 10–15 minutes if he becomes fatigued.  
4. Excuse him from strenuous physical-education activities; low-impact stretching or walking is acceptable.  
5. Encourage meticulous hand-hygiene and prompt reporting of any symptoms of infection, as his medication can lower his immune defenses.  
6. If Ethan reports unusual muscle pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please call his parents and, if needed, my office immediately.

Please keep this information confidential and limited to staff directly involved in Ethan’s care and instruction. If you need additional details for an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or 504 Plan, I am happy to participate once the necessary parental consent forms are in place.

Thank you for your partnership in keeping Ethan healthy and engaged at school. Feel free to reach out any time at this email or by phone at (555)-123-4567.

Warm regards,

Jane Doe, MD
