Hi Mark,

Here’s the latest status on the three candidates we’re considering for the engineering role:

1. Tom Davis
   • Technical screen completed – scored well on system-design questions and coding exercise.
   • Reference checks in progress; so far, feedback is positive.
   • Background check surfaced a minor legal issue from 8 years ago that appears to have been fully resolved. I’m reviewing the documentation and will let you know if anything further is needed.

2. Susan Lee
   • Passed the technical interview with strong marks in AI/ML topics.
   • We’re arranging her final leadership-round interview for next Wednesday (awaiting confirmation from her and from the VP’s calendar).

3. Raj Patel
   • Completed the coding + security case-study interview on Monday – scored highest of the group.
   • Culture-fit interview with the wider team is set for this coming Monday, 10 AM.

Let me know if you’d like any additional detail or adjustments to the interview plan.

Best,
Jane
