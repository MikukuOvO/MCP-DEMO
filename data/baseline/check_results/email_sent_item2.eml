Hi Emily,

Great to hear from you—thanks for reaching out. Below is a concise framework I rely on when working with clients who present with generalized anxiety, panic disorder, or mixed-feature anxiety. I pulled most of this from the CBT protocols and treatment notes in my Notion workspace (see the pages “Cognitive-Behavioral Techniques for Anxiety” and “Recommended Reading on Anxiety Disorders”). Feel free to adapt any element to fit your style and the policies at Greenleaf.

1. Thorough Assessment & Case Formulation
• Use a structured clinical interview + rating scales (GAD-7, BAI, PDSS) to clarify diagnosis and severity.
• Map out pre-disposing, precipitating, perpetuating, and protective factors so you have a clear CBT formulation to guide treatment.

2. Psychoeducation & Normalisation
• Explain the fight/flight response, the role of avoidance, and how anxious thoughts, physical sensations, and behaviours interact.
• Reassure clients that anxiety is common and treatable; this alone often reduces distress.

3. Core CBT Interventions
• Cognitive restructuring: Identify automatic thoughts, challenge cognitive distortions, and generate balanced alternatives.
• Exposure therapy: Build a graded exposure hierarchy (in-vivo and interoceptive) and work through it systematically. Pair with response-prevention so safety behaviours fade.
• Behavioural experiments: Test feared predictions in session and for homework to collect disconfirming evidence.
• Skills training: Diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, 4-7-8 breathing, and guided imagery.

4. Mindfulness & Acceptance Elements
• Brief mindfulness exercises can reduce rumination and worry; 5-minute breathing space or body-scan recordings work well.
• Encourage non-judgemental awareness of bodily sensations during exposure tasks.

5. Coping Toolkit & Relapse Prevention
• Develop a written coping card that lists grounding strategies, crisis numbers, and supportive contacts.
• In final sessions, rehearse setbacks and how the client will respond; schedule booster sessions if feasible.

6. Collaboration & Medication
• For moderate-to-severe presentations, liaise with a physician or psychiatrist regarding SSRIs or SNRIs.
• Monitor side-effects and reinforce that medication enhances—but does not replace—skills practice.

7. Progress Monitoring
• Re-administer GAD-7 or BAI every 3–4 sessions.
• Graph scores with the client so they can see objective improvement.

Recommended Resources (from my Notion page)
• "The Anxiety and Worry Workbook" – Clark & Beck
• "Mind Over Mood" (2nd ed.) – Greenberger & Padesky
• "Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: Mastery" – James
• Any of David Barlow’s work on exposure-based CBT

If you need full copies of the Notion pages or example worksheets (thought records, exposure hierarchy templates, etc.), just let me know and I’ll share them directly.

Hope this is useful! Happy to chat through a specific case whenever you’d like.

Warm regards,
John
