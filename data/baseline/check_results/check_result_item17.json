  "email_content": "Hi MedTech Solutions Team,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. As we prepare for your next software release (currently slated for April 15, 2025), I wanted to share Greenleaf Health Center\u2019s key needs and considerations so that we can ensure a smooth transition for both our staff and patients.\n\n1. Downtime & Scheduling\n\u2022  Preferred maintenance window: Friday 10:00 p.m.\u201312:00 a.m. ET (or another late-evening, low-volume slot)\n\u2022  Please provide at least 48-hours advance notice of any planned outage and a real-time status page link.\n\n2. Data Security & Compliance\n\u2022  Confirmation that all PHI remains encrypted in transit and at rest post-upgrade\n\u2022  Full system backup immediately before the upgrade with a rapid rollback option if needed\n\u2022  Updated HIPAA compliance summary or attestation for our records\n\n3. New Feature Enablement\n\u2022  Wait-list/standby scheduling so cancelled slots can be auto-offered to patients\n\u2022  Bulk SMS reminders directly through the scheduling interface (Twilio or native gateway)\n\u2022  Enhanced reporting: ability to schedule recurring PDF/CSV exports of daily appointment lists and monthly KPI dashboards\n\u2022  Expanded role-based permissions and detailed audit logs for user activity\n\n4. Training & Documentation\n\u2022  30-minute onboarding webinar for front-desk staff plus short video tutorials\n\u2022  Quick-start guide (1\u20132 pages) highlighting any workflow changes\n\u2022  Access to a sandbox/demo environment at least one week prior to go-live so we can test new features with mock data\n\n5. Post-Release Support\n\u2022  Dedicated contact (or ticket queue) for the first two business days after launch\n\u2022  Expected first-response and resolution SLAs during this hyper-care period\n\nThese points are based on internal discussions and notes in our workspace (\u201cUpcoming Software Update \u2013 MedTech Solutions,\u201d 16 May 2025). Please review and let me know if anything requires clarification, or if additional information would be helpful for your team.\n\nThank you for your partnership, and we look forward to the new capabilities.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJane Smith\nMedical Administrative Assistant\nGreenleaf Health Center\nPhone: (555) 123-4567\nEmail: jane@greenleafhc.com",
