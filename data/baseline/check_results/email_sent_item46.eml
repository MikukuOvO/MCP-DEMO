• Fertility goals & any previous treatments/evaluations
   – Our goal is to conceive our first child using donor sperm and to understand the best pathway for us (IUI vs. IVF). 
   – We have not undergone any prior fertility treatments. Dr. Emily Harris, our primary physician, has completed preliminary health screenings for both of us and found no medical concerns that would hinder treatment.

   – 7–9 April (mornings preferred)
   – Weekdays generally work best for us, but we’re happy to adjust if another slot is more convenient.

• Additional notes
   – We are eager to learn more about success rates for lesbian couples, any legal considerations for LGBTQ+ parents, and recommended lifestyle changes prior to treatment.
   – Dr. Harris emphasized the importance of a personalized approach given our unique situation, and we value any guidance your team can provide up front.

Please let us know which appointment date works best or if you need any further information from us ahead of time. 

Thank you for your support—we look forward to working with you!

Warm regards,
Jane Doe & Alex Smith
