Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out. Below is a concise overview of Union Trust Bank’s dispute resolution process along with some additional context that may be useful for your upcoming article on consumer financial protection.  Feel free to quote or attribute as “a Union Trust Bank spokesperson” unless you prefer otherwise.

--------------------------------------------------
Union Trust Bank – Dispute Resolution Process (Retail Banking & Credit Cards)
--------------------------------------------------
1.  Dispute Submission
    •  Channels: secure online portal, 24-hour phone line, or in-branch form.
    •  Time limits: 60 days from statement date for credit cards (Reg Z) and 60 days from error posting for deposit accounts (Reg E).

2.  Acknowledgement & Case Number
    •  Auto-generated confirmation within minutes; formal acknowledgement e-mail/letter within two business days including unique case ID and assigned specialist.

3.  Preliminary Validation (Day 0-2)
    •  Specialist reviews basic eligibility (transaction posted, customer authority, timely filing, supporting documents).  If something is missing, the customer is contacted immediately.

4.  Investigation Phase (Typical Day 2-20)
    •  Evidence gathering: transaction logs, fraud monitoring notes, merchant descriptors, customer-supplied receipts, screenshots, photos, communications, police report if applicable.
    •  Provisional credit: For deposit accounts we issue provisional credit within 10 business days when investigation exceeds that window.  Credit-card customers are not required to pay the amount while the claim is open.

5.  Merchant Engagement (Day 3-25)
    •  We forward the claim to the acquiring bank/merchant via the Visa/Mastercard chargeback network, requesting documentary proof of purchase or service delivery.
    •  Merchant has up to 15 calendar days (domestic) or 30 days (cross-border) to respond.

6.  Decision & Customer Notification (Typical Day 10-30)
    •  If evidence supports the customer, a chargeback/refund is processed the same day and the customer is informed by phone and e-mail.
    •  If the merchant’s evidence is persuasive, the claim is declined with a full written explanation and copies of documentation.

7.  Appeal / Escalation
    •  Customers may request a second-look review within 14 days of an adverse decision.
    •  After the internal appeal, unresolved matters can be escalated to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) or the state banking ombudsman.  Instructions are provided in every final letter.

8.  Timeframes & Metrics (CY 2023)
    •  Average resolution time: 17 days.
    •  % resolved in customer’s favour: 87 %.
    •  Total volume: ~5,200 disputes, 0.04 % of total transactions.

Illustrative Case – Mr. Anderson vs. Luxe Electronics
--------------------------------------------------
•  Transaction: $849.99 purchase of a SmartTech UltraHD TV on 15 Nov 2023.
•  Issue: Device arrived defective; merchant unresponsive.
•  Timeline: Dispute opened 29 Nov → provisional credit issued 1 Dec → merchant failed to provide compelling evidence → chargeback finalised 19 Dec (24 calendar days total).
•  Outcome: Full refund to cardholder; merchant liable for chargeback and fee.

--------------------------------------------------
Common Pitfalls for Consumers
--------------------------------------------------
•  Waiting beyond the 60-day statutory window before notifying the bank.
•  Omitting key documentation (receipts, e-mails with merchant, pictures of defective goods).
•  Cancelling the card before the investigation concludes, which can delay crediting.

--------------------------------------------------

•  Regulation E (Electronic Fund Transfer Act) §1005.11 – Error resolution for deposit and ATM transactions.
