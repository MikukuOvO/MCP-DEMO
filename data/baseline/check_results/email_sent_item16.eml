Hi Mark,

As requested, I have consolidated the most up-to-date information available in Gmail and our shared Notion workspace into the following overview for the Software Development department.

────────────────────────────
1. Budget Snapshot (FY-2025)
────────────────────────────
• Total forecast for Software Development:  US$2.5 M  
  – New-hire allocation:             US$500 K  
  – Planned salary increments:       US$350 K  
  – Operating & tooling costs:       US$1.65 M  
  (Source: “HR Central – Budget Forecasts” – last edited 16 May 2025)

• No material changes have been logged in Finance since the above forecast was posted.  I’ve asked the Finance team for the latest YTD spend file and will append the figures as soon as it lands in my inbox.

────────────────────────────
2. Performance Framework
────────────────────────────
Our KPIs for Engineering, as documented in “HR Central – Performance Metrics”, remain unchanged for the 2025 cycle:
• Project completion rate and schedule adherence  
• Code quality (defect density, PR re-work rates)  
• Sprint velocity & throughput  
• Knowledge-sharing / mentorship contributions  
• Team engagement (eNPS & pulse-survey results)

The most recent narrative summary is the Q1 Performance Report e-mailed 15 Feb 2025, which noted:
• On-time delivery across all departments was trending positively.  
• Budget utilisation for engineering projects was within the forecasted envelope.  

The attachment to that mail is high-level and does not include the granular Engineering-only metrics we track internally (story-point velocity, defect density, etc.).

────────────────────────────
3. Data Gaps & Next Actions
────────────────────────────
• Updated YTD spend & burn-rate – awaiting Finance export (ETA next week).  
• Detailed Engineering KPI dashboard – I’ve pinged the DevOps analytics channel for the latest pull; once received I’ll merge the figures into this document.  
• Head-count tracker – awaiting confirmation on the two open backend roles.

────────────────────────────
4. Deliverables
────────────────────────────
Attached/linked for ease of reference:
• HR Central – Budget Forecasts (Notion link)  
• HR Central – Performance Metrics (Notion link)  
• “Budget Allocation Overview” e-mail (10 Feb 2025)  
• “Q1 Performance Report Summary” e-mail (15 Feb 2025)

I’ll issue an updated, fully-detailed report as soon as the outstanding figures come in so that you have a complete picture before the next leadership sync.

Please let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to drill down on in the meantime.

Best regards,
Jane
