Continue recording any future absences in the timesheet system as usual.  \n2. If Eric raises any requests for flexibility or other support, please refer him to me so we can handle them through the established process.  \n3. Avoid asking Eric for medical details; we will keep you informed of anything that affects scheduling or performance.\n\nPlease let me know if you observe any performance impact or need help adjusting workload in the meantime.\n\nThanks for bringing this to my attention, and feel free to reach out with any further questions.\n\nBest regards,\nJane\nHuman Resources Manager\nTechnotronix",
