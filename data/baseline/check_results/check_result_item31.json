Mortgage refinancing and high-yield savings resonate most.\n\u2022 50+ (\"Boomers+\") \u2013 27 %; branch-loyal segment, but digital adoption is accelerating (mobile log-ins up 19 % YoY). Security/reliability messaging tests best.\n\n2.

Channel & Content Preferences\n\u2022 Short-form video (\u226415 sec) and interactive polls have the highest CTRs on Instagram & TikTok (4.6 % vs. 2.1 % benchmark).\n\u2022 Email remains the most effective conversion channel for 35\u201349; best-performing subject lines emphasize tangible savings (\"Earn up to $300 cash back this summer\").\n\u2022 For 50+, educational webinars (live or on-demand) drive a 2.3\u00d7 lift in product inquiries compared with static blog content.\n\n4. Pain Points & Motivators (Qual + NPS verbatims)\n\u2022 18\u201334: Want instant account opening, zero hidden fees, sustainability-aligned rewards.\n\u2022 35\u201349: Value personalized financial advice and frictionless switching/refi processes.\n\u2022 50+: Seek fraud protection, responsive customer support, and clear guidance on digital use.\n\n5. Recommended Messaging Themes\n\u2022 \"Control & Transparency\" \u2013 showcase in-app spend tracking and fee-free structure.\n\u2022 \"Growth Made Simple\" \u2013 highlight automated savings and budgeting for life milestones.\n\u2022 \"Trusted Partner\" \u2013 emphasize 24/7 fraud monitoring and personalized advisors.\n\nNext Steps\nIf useful, I can provide deeper drill-downs (e.g., state-level data, audience look-alike models, or creative test results) as you solidify persona targets. Just let me know what will help your team the most.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out with any questions or additional data needs.
