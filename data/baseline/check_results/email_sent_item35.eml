Hi Alex and MarketMinds Team,

As requested, please find below the aggregated customer-engagement data for the current analysis project. These figures are drawn from our latest internal dashboard and are anonymised and summarised at a portfolio level (no individual customer-identifiable information is included).

--- Customer Engagement Data (May 2025 snapshot) ---
• Customers aged 25–40 represent 38 % of our active user base, with a median monthly spend of $2,800.
• Mobile-banking adoption is highest among customers under 30, with 72 % using the mobile app for at least 50 % of their transactions.
• Mortgage and auto loans are the two most-utilised lending products, together accounting for 45 % of total loan balances.
• Debit-card usage has grown 18 % year-over-year, driven largely by increased contactless payments.

Please let me know if you need any additional breakdowns or clarification.

Best regards,
Jane Williams
Customer Service Representative | Union Trust Bank
