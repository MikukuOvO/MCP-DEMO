Hi Mark,

I’ve reviewed Eric’s attendance records and the documentation in his personnel file.

• Eric’s absences over the last few weeks are covered by medical documentation that was submitted to HR.  
• Based on the information provided, the time away is considered excused and compliant with company policy.  
• Eric and HR are engaged in the appropriate leave/accommodation process, and we are monitoring his attendance going forward.

Next steps for you:
1. Continue recording any future absences in the timesheet system as usual.  
2. If Eric raises any requests for flexibility or other support, please refer him to me so we can handle them through the established process.  
3. Avoid asking Eric for medical details; we will keep you informed of anything that affects scheduling or performance.

Please let me know if you observe any performance impact or need help adjusting workload in the meantime.

Thanks for bringing this to my attention, and feel free to reach out with any further questions.

Best regards,
Jane
Human Resources Manager
