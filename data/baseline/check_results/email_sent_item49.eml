Dear Oakwood Teaching Alliance,

I hope everyone is doing well. After reviewing our recent correspondence and cross-checking the Care Log, I’d like to share the latest snapshot of medical and testing accommodations so that we can finalize plans for the remainder of the spring term.

1. Emily Watson (Grade 5 – Ms. Carter)
   • Medical condition: Epilepsy with occasional absence seizures.
   • Daily classroom supports:
        – Permission to keep a covered water bottle at her desk.
        – Seating away from any flickering or strobe-style lighting.
        – Immediate hall pass to the Health Office if she reports an aura or appears confused.
   • Exam/assessment supports:
        – 50 % extended time.
        – Quiet, distraction-reduced setting (preferably Room 103, close to the Health Office).
        – Breaks as needed; student may stand, stretch, or use the restroom under supervision.
        – Nurse (or trained delegate) on call and available within 1 minute.
   • Emergency plan: Rescue medication (Diastat) is stored in the Health Office; a sealed back-up kit will be placed in the testing room each morning of a scheduled exam.
   • Upcoming dates to note:
        – Reading Benchmarks: 2–6 May
        – State Math & ELA Assessments: 9–13 May

2. New Requests / Changes
   • At this time, no new medical accommodation requests have been submitted to the Health Office in the past month.
   • If you are aware of any students who may need support for the upcoming assessments (e.g., anxiety management, concussion recovery, district 504 plans, etc.), please forward the information to me by this Friday, 22 April so that we can prepare the proper documentation and resources.

3. Action Items for Staff
   • Confirm that Room 103 is reserved for Emily’s testing sessions on the dates above.
   • Ensure you have easy access to my direct line (ext. 214) during all accommodated assessments.
   • Remind students with health plans to check in with me prior to the start of state testing week to review any medication schedules.

Thank you all for your diligence and collaboration. Please let me know if there are any questions or if additional adjustments are needed.

Warm regards,
