  "email_content": "Hi Alex,\n\nThank you for reaching out.\n\nBased on my market research, eight years of development experience (including three years at TechSolutions), and the scope of responsibilities we discussed, I believe a total annual cash compensation in the range of $150,000 \u2013 $165,000 is appropriate for the Lead Developer role. This range assumes a base salary of approximately $140,000 \u2013 $155,000 with the remainder in performance-based bonus or equity.\n\nI\u2019m, of course, open to discussing the overall compensation package (benefits, equity, growth opportunities, etc.) to find a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information. I look forward to the next steps.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\n",
