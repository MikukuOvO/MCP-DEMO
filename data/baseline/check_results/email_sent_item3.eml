Hi Lisa,

Hope you’re doing well, and thanks for offering to help track down the best deals!

Below is the list of items that I’m looking to purchase next, along with the kinds of discounts or promotions I’m hoping to take advantage of:

1. High-End Gaming Laptop – Preferably RTX 4080/4090-class. Target budget: under $2,500 after discounts.
   • Open-box or certified-refurbished options are fine as long as they include a full warranty.
   • Any manufacturer rebates or upcoming seasonal sales would be great.

2. Electric Standing Desk (≈60" × 30", dual-motor) – Target budget: around $500.
   • If there are “new-customer” or furniture-category coupon codes, I’d love to apply them.
   • I’m open to bundle deals that include accessories (cable management trays, monitor arm, etc.).

3. Professional Espresso Machine (e.g., Breville Dual Boiler class) – Target budget: about $1,200.
   • I’d appreciate heads-up on holiday/flash sales or any manufacturer instant-savings.
   • Willing to consider floor-model or open-box units if the warranty remains intact.

Loyalty/Bundle Savings:
I’ve recently purchased an UltraHD 4K TV, wireless noise-cancelling headphones, and a smart home security system through MarketHub. If my purchase history qualifies me for additional loyalty discounts, please factor those in as well.

Let me know what offers or bundles you can assemble, and I’ll be ready to check out right away.

Thanks again for your help—looking forward to your reply!

Best regards,
John
