I reviewed the recent culture-feedback notes and the performance evaluations, and a few common themes came through: the team is eager for more creative problem-solving opportunities, open cross-functional communication, and strategic \u201cbig-picture\u201d thinking. With that in mind, here are some ideas for the retreat:\\n\\n1. Innovation Hackathon (\u00bd-day)\\n   \u2022 Small, cross-disciplinary teams work on a passion project or pain point outside their day-to-day scope.\\n   \u2022 Culminates in quick demos and peer voting. Provides the \u201cplatform for sharing innovative ideas\u201d that people asked for in the culture survey.\\n\\n2. Strategy Sandbox Workshop (2 hrs)\\n   \u2022 Scenario-planning exercise where groups respond to a sudden market shift and pitch their approach.\\n   \u2022 Builds on the adaptability strengths we saw in reviews (e.g., Mark\u2019s strategic thinking) while sharpening big-picture alignment.\\n\\n3. Communication Lab Role-Play (90 min)\\n   \u2022 Guided by an external facilitator or our L&D lead.\\n   \u2022 Participants practice delivering complex updates to other departments and receive feedback. This targets the inter-departmental communication gaps highlighted in several evaluations.\\n\\n4. Team-Bonding \u201cEscape the Code\u201d Challenge (Fun Evening Activity)\\n   \u2022 Tech-themed escape-room style puzzle that requires collaboration across job functions.\\n\\n5. Wellness & Reflection Blocks\\n   \u2022 Morning mindfulness or gentle hike to keep everyone energised.\\n   \u2022 End-of-day fireside chat where people share take-aways and give kudos.\\n\\nLogistics & Misc.\\n\u2022 2.5 days has worked well for us in the past\u2014enough time to dive deep without tying everyone up for a full week.\\n\u2022 A venue with flexible indoor spaces (for hackathon/workshops) plus outdoor areas (for wellness activities) would be ideal.\\n\u2022 If budget allows, consider recording hackathon demos so teams can continue iterating post-retreat.\\n\\nI\u2019m happy to flesh out agendas or coordinate facilitators\u2014just let me know how I can help.\\n\\nBest,\\nJohn\"}"
