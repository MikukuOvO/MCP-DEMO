Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out. I’ve reviewed the background materials in Gmail and the Social Committee workspace and put together a few ideas that align with the themes the team has been emphasizing lately:

1. Innovation Hackathon – A half-day rapid-ideation session where mixed-function teams tackle a real business challenge and pitch their solutions. This taps into the desire for creative problem-solving and lets people collaborate outside their usual silos.

2. Strategy & Communication Workshop – A facilitated workshop focused on cross-department communication and big-picture thinking. Small groups would map out a strategic initiative, then practice presenting it concisely to other groups for feedback.

3. Outdoor Team Challenge – Light physical activities (think low-ropes style) that emphasize trust and problem-solving. Keeps energy high and provides a change of scenery after the indoor sessions.

4. Reflection Circles – Short, guided discussions at the end of each day where participants share key takeaways and commit to one actionable insight. Helps reinforce learning and drives post-retreat follow-through.

5. Optional Mindfulness / Recharge Session – A brief guided mindfulness or yoga session to give attendees a mental reset before the evening program.

Logistics & Flow (suggested):
• Day 1 AM – Kickoff & Innovation Hackathon
• Day 1 PM – Outdoor Team Challenge, followed by Reflection Circles
• Day 2 AM – Strategy & Communication Workshop
• Day 2 PM – Mindfulness Session, Closing Reflection, and Social Evening

Let me know which of these resonate, and I can help flesh out timing, facilitators, or resource needs. Happy to discuss further whenever convenient.

Best,
John
