Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to reach out and introduce myself ahead of our upcoming project together.

I recently joined Zenith Innovations and will be partnering with you on the new initiative. My background is in [your department/role], and over the past few years I’ve earned several professional certifications that focus on process improvement and collaborative workflow design. Outside of work, I stay active by volunteering with a local community-support organization and spend my free time exploring photography and hiking trails.

I’m excited to contribute my experience and learn from yours as we move the project forward. Please feel free to reply here any time—I’m always happy to jump on a quick call or chat if that’s easier.

Looking forward to working closely with you!

Best regards,
John
