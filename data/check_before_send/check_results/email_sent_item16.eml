Hi Mark,

As requested, I’ve pulled the latest data from our HR workspace and finance dashboards and compiled a concise overview below. A fully formatted slide deck and spreadsheet with line-item detail will follow later today once I finish polishing the charts.

–––––
PERFORMANCE SNAPSHOT (current fiscal year-to-date)

Software Development
• Project on-time delivery: ~92% (up slightly from the previous quarter)
• Average defect density: ↓ ~15%
• Sprint-velocity adherence: ~89% of planned story points completed

Digital Marketing
• Campaign ROI: ~4.2 : 1 (approx. 10% above target)
• Lead-to-customer conversion: ~7.8% (modest gain versus last period)
• Social engagement: +24% year-over-year

Company-Wide
• Employee turnover remains low and below industry average.
• Training participation rate has exceeded the annual target, supporting continued skill growth.

BUDGET STATUS & FORECAST (next fiscal year assumptions)

Software Development – Total forecast: US$2.5 M
   – Planned new hires: 0.5 M
   – Salary adjustments & merit: 0.35 M
   – Operational & tooling costs: 1.65 M
   – YTD utilisation: ~43% of annual allocation (on track)

Digital Marketing – Total forecast: US$1.2 M
   – Core campaign spend remains under budget by ~8%, creating flexibility for experimental channels.

Company-Wide L&D – Forecast: US$0.4 M
Contingency / Innovation Fund – Forecast: US$0.3 M

Key Observations
1. Development spend is pacing well with room for two additional engineers if pipeline demands.
2. Marketing efficiencies have freed up roughly 8% of their allocation; consider redeploying to high-growth channels next quarter.
3. KPI trends indicate steady improvement; no critical performance risks identified at this time.

Next Steps
• I’ll circulate the full detailed report (PDF + XLS) by end of day.
• Let me know if there are specific comparison periods or additional KPIs you’d like highlighted.

Thanks, and please reach out if you need any interim figures.

Best regards,
