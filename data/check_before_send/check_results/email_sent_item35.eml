Hi Alex,

As requested, please find below the latest aggregated customer engagement data from our internal analysis. All figures are anonymized and reflect broader trends across our retail banking customer base.

Key Engagement Insights:
• Customers aged 25–40 comprise approximately 38% of active users, with a median monthly spend of about $2,800.
• Mobile banking adoption is highest among customers under 30; roughly 72% of them conduct at least half of their transactions via the mobile app.
• Mortgage and auto loans together represent about 45% of total loan balances across the portfolio.
• Debit card usage has grown by roughly 18% year-over-year, driven in part by the broader shift toward contactless payments.

Please let me know if you need any additional breakdowns or clarification.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
Customer Service Representative
