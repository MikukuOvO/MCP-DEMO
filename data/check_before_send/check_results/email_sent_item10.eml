Hi Sarah,

Here’s a concise update on Project Falcon:

• Phase: We’re in Phase 2 (implementation).
• Creative assets: All new marketing materials have been finalized and early test-group feedback is very encouraging.
• Digital strategy: Initial testing of the online components is complete; engagement metrics look strong, particularly on mobile.
• Social media approach: I’ve noted the adjustments you suggested and will bring options to our next team discussion so we can lock them in.
• Next steps: Integrate the test feedback, finalize the rollout schedule and confirm resource allocation for launch.

Let me know if you’d like any additional detail before our next meeting.

Thanks for your collaboration,
John
