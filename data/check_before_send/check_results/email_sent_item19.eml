Dear Mrs. Thompson,

Below is the summary you requested regarding Timmy’s current health status and immunizations for Pine Grove Elementary’s records.

Immunizations
• Timmy is up-to-date with all state-required vaccines, including DTaP, MMR, Varicella, Polio, Hep A, Hep B, Hib, PCV, seasonal influenza, and his age-appropriate COVID-19 series.
• No additional doses are due at this time. His next routine vaccines (Tdap, HPV, and Meningococcal) will be scheduled when he approaches 11 years of age.

Asthma & General Health
• Timmy’s asthma is currently well-controlled on his daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid. He uses his albuterol inhaler only as needed, with no recent exacerbations.
• Please continue to keep his rescue inhaler accessible at school and help him avoid known triggers (dust, mold, and outdoor allergens during high-pollen periods).
• He has fully recovered from his previous respiratory infection and has had no further complications.

Please let me know if you need the formal immunization record, additional documentation, or updated action plan forms— I will be happy to provide them.

Thank you for helping keep Timmy healthy and safe at school.

Warm regards,
Dr. Jane
Happy Valley Children’s Clinic
