  "email_content": "Hi Lisa,\n\nThank you for reaching out. Below is a concise overview that should help you get started with Ethan. I\u2019ve pulled these points together from my notes and recent observations so you have the essentials without being overwhelmed.\n\n1. Daily Rhythm & Structure\n\u2022 Ethan does best with a consistent sequence of activities: wake-up, breakfast, light movement, a focused tabletop task, lunch, quiet leisure, therapy session, dinner, then a calming wind-down before bed.\n\u2022 Transitions are smoother when he is given a brief verbal reminder (e.g., \u201cIn five minutes we\u2019ll switch to\u2026\u201d).\n\n2. Food & Mealtime Preferences\n\u2022 Prefers warm, soft-to-medium textures and will typically refuse very cold dishes.\n\u2022 Favorite, reliable snacks: apple slices with peanut butter, or crackers with cheese.\n\u2022 A quiet setting during meals helps him stay regulated; sudden loud noises can cause him to stop eating.\n\n3. Interests & Motivators\n\u2022 Animals and nature shows are big hits \u2013 a short clip or a picture of an animal can be a nice reward.\n\u2022 Enjoys water play and is interested in learning basic swimming skills when the opportunity arises.\n\u2022 Creative outlets such as drawing or painting help him relax; having art supplies within easy reach is useful.\n\n4. Communication & Sensory Support\n\u2022 He is practicing asking for breaks when overwhelmed. Offering a calm \u201cbreak space\u201d and acknowledging the request quickly reinforces this skill.\n\u2022 Clear, step-by-step directions work best; visual prompts (simple pictures or written lists) can be very helpful.\n\u2022 If the environment becomes noisy or crowded, gentle redirection to a quieter area prevents overload.\n\n5. General Approach\n\u2022 Positive reinforcement and offering limited choices (e.g., \u201cWould you like puzzle time or drawing next?\u201d) keep him engaged and feeling in control.\n\u2022 Consistency across caregivers is key, so mirroring this routine and language will make your sessions smoother.\n\nI hope this gives you a solid starting point. Let me know if you\u2019d like more detail on any section or if questions come up as you spend time with him.\n\nLooking forward to working together!\n\nWarm regards,\nJane",
