Hello Rainbow Fertility Care Team,

Thank you for the opportunity to schedule an initial consultation.

• Full name & pronouns: Jane Doe (she/her)
• Partner’s name & pronouns: Alex Smith (they/them)

Brief overview of our goals/concerns:
We are a same-sex couple hoping to conceive our first child and would like guidance on the most suitable pathways (e.g., IUI or IVF) and the overall process from medical, legal, and financial perspectives. Neither of us has undergone fertility treatment before, and we currently have no known fertility-related health conditions.

Relevant medical history:
Both of us are in good general health, with regular physical exams and up-to-date wellness screenings. We have not pursued any previous fertility evaluations or treatments.

Preferred appointment windows (Eastern Time):
• Weekdays between 9:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. during March 15 – 20
• Weekdays between 9:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. during April 5 – 10
If none of these slots are available, please let us know alternative times and we will do our best to accommodate.

Questions we would appreciate discussing during the consultation:
1. Success rates for IUI and IVF for lesbian couples.
2. Legal considerations we should prepare for (parentage, donor agreements, etc.).
3. Recommended dietary or lifestyle adjustments prior to treatment.

Please let us know if you need any additional information. We look forward to working with your team and confirming a consultation time.

Warm regards,
Jane & Alex
