Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you for following up and for the invitation to contribute to Vital Voices. I would be honored to take part in an interview or provide a guest article.

Could you please share your preferred format, approximate word count, any editorial guidelines, and the timeline you have in mind? If an interview works best, just let me know some potential dates and times, and I will do my best to accommodate.

I’m excited about the opportunity to work together and help advance Vital Voices’ mission.

Looking forward to your guidance on the next steps.

Warm regards,
Jane
