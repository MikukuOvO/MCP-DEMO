Hi Angela,

Here is the latest snapshot of the Zenith Wellness Initiative:

• Participation & Engagement
  – Overall enrollment continues to rise, with participation now approaching eight out of every ten employees.
  – Attendance at weekly movement sessions and stress-management workshops has been consistently strong, and feedback surveys indicate high satisfaction and perceived value.

• Resources & Activities in Place
  – On-site fitness access, nutritional planning support, and guided mindfulness sessions remain the core offerings.
  – The new quarterly seminar series has been scheduled, with the first topic focusing on building sustainable exercise habits.

• Health Assessment Insights (Aggregated)
  – Initial health screenings show encouraging trends in weight management and cardiovascular indicators across the participant group.
  – These collective results are being used to fine-tune upcoming modules so they address the most common employee needs.

• Next Steps
  – Launch a short mid-year pulse survey to gather additional qualitative feedback.
  – Coordinate with Facilities to expand healthy snack options in common areas.
  – Finalize incentives for the summer activity challenge.

Please let me know if you’d like deeper detail on any specific area.

Best regards,
John
