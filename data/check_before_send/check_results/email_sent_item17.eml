Hello MedTech Solutions Team,

I hope you are doing well. Below is a concise overview of Greenleaf Health Center’s operational requirements for the upcoming release of the scheduling and management system:

1. Downtime Coordination
   • Please confirm the anticipated duration and planned window (mid-April) for any service interruption so we can adjust staffing and patient communications accordingly.

2. Appointment Continuity
   • An offline‐access option or advance export of our appointment calendar would help us manage bookings if the system is temporarily unavailable.

3. Release Notes & Staff Training
   • Early access to release notes and short training materials at least one week before the update will allow us to brief staff and update internal SOPs.

4. Data Integrity & Rollback Plan
   • Assurance that all existing patient records will remain intact after the update, along with a documented rollback procedure should any issues arise.

5. Live Support During Roll-out
   • A direct support contact or hotline during the roll-out window would facilitate swift resolution of any unexpected concerns.

These items are critical because we anticipate above-average patient volume during that period, and minimizing disruption is paramount.

Please let me know if any additional information is required.

Thank you for your continued partnership.

Best regards,
Jane
Medical Administrative Assistant
Greenleaf Health Center
