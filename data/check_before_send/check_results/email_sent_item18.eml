Hi Mark,

Thank you for reaching out. Below is an overview of Union Trust Bank’s dispute resolution process that you’re welcome to reference in your article. I’ve also added a few contextual notes about consumer protections that guide our approach.

Union Trust Bank – Dispute Resolution Process (High-Level)
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Complaint Initiation
   • Customers can open a dispute through our secure online portal, by phone, or in person at any branch.
   • An acknowledgement e-mail or letter is automatically generated, confirming receipt and providing a unique case number for tracking.

2. Preliminary Review & Assignment
   • A customer-care specialist performs an initial assessment to ensure we have enough information to proceed.
   • The case is assigned to the appropriate investigations team (card, deposit, loan, or digital-banking).

3. Investigation Phase
   • Investigators gather evidence from the customer, relevant internal records, the merchant (when applicable), and card networks.
   • Throughout the investigation we follow the timelines set out in Regulation E (Electronic Fund Transfer Act) for deposit accounts and Regulation Z (Truth in Lending Act) for credit cards, as well as CFPB guidance.
   • For card disputes, a provisional credit may be issued to the customer in accordance with these regulations while the review is ongoing.

4. Decision & Customer Notification
   • Once all documentation has been assessed, the customer receives a written outcome explaining the findings and any actions taken (e.g., charge reversal, account correction, or explanation of why the transaction stands).
   • If financial remediation is required, credits are posted to the customer’s account promptly after the decision is made.

5. Escalation & Further Review
   • If the customer is not satisfied, they may request an internal appeal that is handled by our Dispute Resolution Review Committee.
   • Beyond our internal process, customers can escalate matters to the financial ombudsman service or file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Consumer-Protection Principles We Follow
---------------------------------------
• Transparency – clear communication at every stage; access to case-status updates online.
• Timeliness – regulatory deadlines guide our internal service-level objectives.
• Impartiality – investigations are handled by staff who were not involved in the original transaction.
• Data Security – all evidence and correspondence are stored in encrypted case-management systems.

I hope this gives you the detail you need, but please let me know if any additional clarification would be helpful. I’m happy to answer follow-up questions or provide publicly available statistics on dispute volumes and resolution times, if that would support your piece.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
Customer Service Representative
