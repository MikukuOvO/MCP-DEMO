Hi Oakwood Owlets team,

Below is a concise overview of our class group-project, action items, and the key school deadlines to keep on everyone’s radar.

1. Oakwood Owlets Group-Project Plan

• Theme: “Our Changing Planet – Local Ecosystems in Focus.”  
• Project Phases: 
  – Exploration & Topic Selection (in progress)  
  – Research & Data-Gathering  
  – Prototype / Display Creation

• Student Roles:

A current, private contact sheet for each student’s parent or guardian is maintained in our secure class workspace. Everyone with access to the Owlets shared drive/Notion page can reference or update it as needed. (We’re keeping personal phone numbers and e-mail addresses off group e-mails to protect privacy.)
