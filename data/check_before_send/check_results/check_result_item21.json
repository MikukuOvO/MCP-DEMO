  "email_content": "Hello Alex,\n\nThank you for submitting your project. I\u2019ve reviewed your work and wanted to share a few observations:\n\n\u2022 Your data analysis is thorough and clearly demonstrates a strong command of the course concepts.\n\u2022 The visualizations you included effectively support your findings and help communicate your argument.\n\u2022 To make the paper even stronger, consider refining your hypothesis into a concise, focused statement. A sharper hypothesis will better guide readers through your analysis.\n\nNext steps you might find helpful:\n\u2022 Rephrase the hypothesis in one or two precise sentences.\n\u2022 Double-check that your research question aligns closely with the revised hypothesis.\n\u2022 As you revise, make sure each section links back to this central question to maintain a clear narrative.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to discuss these points further, feel free to drop by during office hours or let me know, and we can set up a quick meeting.\n\nBest regards,\nProfessor Jane",
