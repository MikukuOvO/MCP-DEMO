Hi Mark,

Great to hear from you! Hereâ€™s what I have that should help us pull the surprise together:

â€¢ Birthday date: Alexâ€™s birthday is on March 1st.
â€¢ Days off: He normally has Tuesdays and Thursdays off, so either of those days would be safest to catch him free and relaxed.
â€¢ Venue: Rather than meet at his place, Iâ€™d suggest booking a cozy spot near his neighborhood or even reserving a small room at the precinctâ€™s community center so we keep everything under wraps and avoid inconveniencing him at home.
â€¢ Gift idea: A rugged smartwatch built for first-responders (GPS, discreet notifications, good durability) would match his work perfectly and something heâ€™s mentioned admiring in the past.

Let me know which date/venue you prefer and Iâ€™ll help coordinate invites and any dÃ©cor or food orders.

Cheers,
Jane
