Hi Dr. Strauss,

As requested, here are the summary statistics for the prevalence of key genetic markers within the population I counsel. All figures are aggregated and fully de-identified:

â€¢ BRCA1 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants: 5% prevalence.

I am currently compiling additional statistics for other markers (e.g., BRCA2, APC, MLH1, APOE). I will forward those figures as soon as the analysis is finalized. Please let me know if you need the data in a different format or if there are specific markers you would like prioritized.

Best regards,

Jane Doe, MS, CGC
