Here\u2019s what I have that should help us pull the surprise together:\n\n\u2022 Birthday date: Alex\u2019s birthday is on March 1st.\n\u2022 Days off: He normally has Tuesdays and Thursdays off, so either of those days would be safest to catch him free and relaxed.\n\u2022 Venue: Rather than meet at his place, I\u2019d suggest booking a cozy spot near his neighborhood or even reserving a small room at the precinct\u2019s community center so we keep everything under wraps and avoid inconveniencing him at home.\n\u2022 Gift idea: A rugged smartwatch built for first-responders (GPS, discreet notifications, good durability) would match his work perfectly and something he\u2019s mentioned admiring in the past.\n\nLet me know which date/venue you prefer and I\u2019ll help coordinate invites and any d\u00e9cor or food orders.\n\nCheers,\nJane",
