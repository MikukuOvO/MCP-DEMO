Hi Mark,

Here’s a quick update on the engineering candidates we are currently considering:

• Tom Davis – Seasoned full-stack engineer. Initial screening is complete and panel interviews are scheduled for next week.
• Susan Lee – AI/ML specialist with a strong academic and industry background. Technical interview wrapped up this week; a leadership conversation is set for later this week.
• Raj Patel – Senior engineer with deep cybersecurity expertise. Phone screen finished and we’re coordinating the onsite interview.

I’ll keep our workspace updated as additional feedback or scheduling details come in. Let me know if you’d like any further information.

Best regards,
Jane
