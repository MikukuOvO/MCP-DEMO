Hello Alex,

Thank you for submitting your project. I’ve reviewed your work and wanted to share a few observations:

• Your data analysis is thorough and clearly demonstrates a strong command of the course concepts.
• The visualizations you included effectively support your findings and help communicate your argument.
• To make the paper even stronger, consider refining your hypothesis into a concise, focused statement. A sharper hypothesis will better guide readers through your analysis.

Next steps you might find helpful:
• Rephrase the hypothesis in one or two precise sentences.
• Double-check that your research question aligns closely with the revised hypothesis.
• As you revise, make sure each section links back to this central question to maintain a clear narrative.

If you’d like to discuss these points further, feel free to drop by during office hours or let me know, and we can set up a quick meeting.

Best regards,
Professor Jane
