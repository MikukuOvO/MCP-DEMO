Hello Oakwood Teaching Alliance,

Please find below the latest summary of learning and medical accommodations currently in place. Kindly keep this information confidential and implement the supports as outlined.

Student Accommodations
--------------------------------------------------
Emily W.
• Quiet, low-stimulation setting for all quizzes, tests, and major assessments.
• 50 % additional time on assessments.
• Permission to have a water bottle and light snack at her desk.
• Seat near the door and allowance for brief movement breaks when needed.
• If signs of distress appear, escort Emily to the Health Office and follow the emergency care plan kept in the staff binder.

At this time, no other students have active medical or learning accommodations beyond those already documented in their regular classroom plans. I will update you immediately if new information arises.

General Reminders
--------------------------------------------------
• Please ensure emergency medications (e.g., inhalers, EpiPens) remain accessible during class and on field trips.
• Notify me of any upcoming assessments, off-campus activities, or schedule changes so I can verify that accommodations remain in place.
• Direct any questions or concerns to me at the Health Office extension.

Thank you for your continued collaboration in supporting our students.

Warm regards,
Jane
School Nurse | Oakwood Elementary
