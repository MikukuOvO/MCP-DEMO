Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well today. As promised, I’ve put together some practical, research-backed ideas you can try when you notice stress starting to build. You don’t have to do all of them at once—feel free to experiment and see which ones fit best with your life.

1. Mindful Breathing (5-5-5)
   • Inhale slowly through your nose for a count of five, hold for five, and exhale for five. Repeat for 1–2 minutes to calm the nervous system.

2. Progressive Muscle Relaxation
   • Starting at your feet and working upward, gently tense each muscle group for about five seconds, then release. A full body scan usually takes 3–4 minutes and can ease physical tension.

3. Move Your Body
   • Even a brisk ten-minute walk, light stretching, or a quick set of jumping jacks can release endorphins and lower stress hormones.

4. Schedule Mini-Breaks
   • Set a timer to step away from email or work every 60–90 minutes. A short pause to stretch, drink water, or look out a window helps reset focus.

5. Digital Boundaries
   • Try a "no-screen" buffer—about 30 minutes before bed—to let your mind wind down. Dimming lights and reading a paper book can improve sleep quality.

6. Balanced Fuel
   • Aim for steady energy by including protein, fiber, and healthy fats at meals. Staying hydrated supports mood and concentration.

7. Consistent Sleep Routine
   • Going to bed and waking up around the same time each day trains your body’s internal clock and reduces overall stress reactivity.

8. Gratitude or Reflection Pause
   • Jot down three good things—big or small—that happened today. This quick exercise has been shown to shift attention away from stressors and toward supportive experiences.

9. Connect With Others
   • A brief phone call, text, or coffee with a friend can provide perspective and emotional support.

10. Gentle Self-Talk
   • Notice critical thoughts and reframe them the way you’d speak to a close friend—kind, realistic, and encouraging.

Tip for getting started: Pick one or two techniques and practice them consistently for a week. Small, repeatable actions tend to build lasting habits.

Please let me know which of these resonate with you or if you’d like more detail on any of them. We can also tailor strategies further during our next session.

Take care,

Jane
