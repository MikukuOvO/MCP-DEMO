Hi Alex,

Thank you for reaching out.

After reviewing current market data for senior engineering roles and reflecting on my experience leading critical projects at TechSolutions, I would be looking for a total compensation package in the range of:

• Base salary: $135 000–$145 000
• Annual performance bonus: 10–15 % of base
• Equity: a meaningful stock-option grant appropriate for a leadership position

I’m flexible on the exact mix of cash and equity and am happy to discuss any details to ensure we arrive at a package that aligns with InnovateX’s compensation philosophy and the value I aim to deliver.

Please let me know if there’s anything else you need ahead of our next conversation.

Best regards,
John
