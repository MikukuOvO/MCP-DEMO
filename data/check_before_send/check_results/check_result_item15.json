All figures are aggregated and fully de-identified:\n\n\u2022 BRCA1 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants: 5% prevalence.\n\nI am currently compiling additional statistics for other markers (e.g., BRCA2, APC, MLH1, APOE). I will forward those figures as soon as the analysis is finalized. Please let me know if you need the data in a different format or if there are specific markers you would like prioritized.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJane Doe, MS, CGC\nGenetic Counselor",
