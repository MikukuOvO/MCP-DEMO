Hi Team,

I hope you're all doing well. I’d like to share several important updates regarding our workspace and the way we’ll be managing projects over the next few weeks.

1. Office Renovation
• Renovation work begins next week and is expected to run for roughly four weeks.
• The main focus will be on the ground-floor common areas and the break room.
• Colleagues normally seated on the ground floor will be temporarily relocated to the upper floors; Facilities will circulate a seating map shortly.
• Certain areas will be cordoned off – please follow posted signs and allow extra time when moving around the office.
• We’ll keep noise disruption to a minimum, and we appreciate your patience during this period.

2. Environmental Comfort
• Facilities are adjusting temperature settings for greater consistency.
• A pilot of designated quiet zones is being organized based on recent feedback. More details will be shared soon.

3. AgileBoost Workflow Roll-out
• We are adopting the AgileBoost platform to streamline project tracking and cross-team collaboration.
• Key milestones:
   – System configuration is underway.
   – Workflow customization and user-acceptance testing will follow shortly.
   – Team-wide training sessions are being scheduled; invitations will be sent soon.
   – Full go-live is targeted for the end of next month.
• Please plan to attend one training session; recordings and quick-start guides will be available for reference.

4. Support & Questions
If you have questions regarding seating, equipment, or AgileBoost access, please contact:
• Facilities: facilities@innosoft.com
• IT Support: it-support@innosoft.com

Thank you all for your flexibility and cooperation as we enhance our workspace and processes.

Best regards,
John
