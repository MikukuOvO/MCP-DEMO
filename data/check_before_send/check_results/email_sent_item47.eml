Hello Justice for All Legal Aid Team,

I’m excited to start working with you and to connect community members who could benefit from your immigration legal services.

• Carlos – a community member who is looking for guidance on his immigration case and would welcome an introduction to your team.

• Community Resources – I have a compiled list of local pro bono immigration attorneys, legal clinics, and non-profit organizations that regularly collaborate with our advocacy network. I’m happy to forward the full list or set up a call to walk through how these resources might complement your work.

Please let me know the best next step, and I can make direct introductions or share additional materials.

Thank you for partnering with our community. I look forward to supporting your efforts.

Warm regards,
Jane
