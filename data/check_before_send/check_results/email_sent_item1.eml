Hi Sarah,

As requested, here’s a concise recap of the key points from our latest conversation on therapy methods, drawing from the notes I’ve organized in my Notion workspace:

1. Integrative Focus
   • We explored pairing the Mindful Acceptance Approach (MAA) with the Integrated Behavioral Framework (IBF).  
   • The goal is to blend present-moment awareness and self-compassion (MAA) with IBF’s structured behavioral activation and goal-setting.

2. Anticipated Benefits
   • Greater patient engagement: mindfulness helps clients notice triggers without judgment, while IBF translates insight into concrete action steps.  
   • Improved adherence: the combined model seems to reduce avoidance and increase follow-through on homework.  
   • Enhanced self-efficacy: clients report feeling more equipped to manage day-to-day stressors when mindful reflection is immediately paired with behavioral planning.

3. Practical Application
   • Begin sessions with a brief grounding exercise (2–3 minutes of mindful breathing or body scan).  
   • Transition into IBF goal-setting, selecting 1–2 specific, measurable tasks for the week.  
   • Close with reflective journaling prompts so clients can track successes or obstacles in real time.

4. Evaluation & Next Steps
   • We’ll monitor progress using session-by-session outcome measures and qualitatively note changes in avoidance, mood regulation, and homework completion.  
   • I’ll draft a brief protocol outline and share it with you shortly for your feedback.  
   • Let’s plan a follow-up call next week to compare early impressions and refine the structure.

Let me know if I missed anything or if you’d like deeper detail on any section. Looking forward to continuing our collaboration.

Best,
John
