I understand the concern that rumors can cause and I\u2019m happy to share the information that is currently cleared for public distribution:\n\n\u2022 TeamBoost Workshops \u2013 These company-wide sessions are continuing as planned and are open to all teams. Their aim is to strengthen collaboration and efficiency across the organization.
