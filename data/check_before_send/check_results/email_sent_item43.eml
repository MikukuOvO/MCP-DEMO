Hi Lisa,

Thank you for reaching out. Below is a concise overview that should help you get started with Ethan. I’ve pulled these points together from my notes and recent observations so you have the essentials without being overwhelmed.

1. Daily Rhythm & Structure
• Ethan does best with a consistent sequence of activities: wake-up, breakfast, light movement, a focused tabletop task, lunch, quiet leisure, therapy session, dinner, then a calming wind-down before bed.
• Transitions are smoother when he is given a brief verbal reminder (e.g., “In five minutes we’ll switch to…”).

2. Food & Mealtime Preferences
• Prefers warm, soft-to-medium textures and will typically refuse very cold dishes.
• Favorite, reliable snacks: apple slices with peanut butter, or crackers with cheese.
• A quiet setting during meals helps him stay regulated; sudden loud noises can cause him to stop eating.

3. Interests & Motivators
• Animals and nature shows are big hits – a short clip or a picture of an animal can be a nice reward.
• Enjoys water play and is interested in learning basic swimming skills when the opportunity arises.
• Creative outlets such as drawing or painting help him relax; having art supplies within easy reach is useful.

4. Communication & Sensory Support
• He is practicing asking for breaks when overwhelmed. Offering a calm “break space” and acknowledging the request quickly reinforces this skill.
• Clear, step-by-step directions work best; visual prompts (simple pictures or written lists) can be very helpful.
• If the environment becomes noisy or crowded, gentle redirection to a quieter area prevents overload.

5. General Approach
• Positive reinforcement and offering limited choices (e.g., “Would you like puzzle time or drawing next?”) keep him engaged and feeling in control.
• Consistency across caregivers is key, so mirroring this routine and language will make your sessions smoother.

I hope this gives you a solid starting point. Let me know if you’d like more detail on any section or if questions come up as you spend time with him.

Looking forward to working together!

Warm regards,
Jane
