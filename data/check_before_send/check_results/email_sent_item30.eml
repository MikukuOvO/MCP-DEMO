Hi Mark,

I’ve reviewed Eric’s attendance records and the documentation on file. His recent absences are supported by the appropriate paperwork and relate to a medical matter for which HR is already providing assistance. At this time the time away is considered excused, and we’ll keep monitoring the situation and let you know if anything changes that impacts scheduling or coverage.

Please continue recording the days as approved leave for now. If you have any operational concerns or need further guidance, just let me know.

Best regards,
Jane
Human Resources Manager
Technotronix
