Hi Sarah,

Here’s a concise recap of the key points we covered during our recent session at the business hub:

• Financial overview – confirmed successful close of the latest funding round and reviewed last-quarter spend patterns.
• Strategic partnerships & market expansion – outlined plans to partner with larger tech firms and prepare for entry into South American and Asian markets later this year.
• Q2 product launch – agreed on next-step actions for the upcoming release, with a digital-first marketing campaign aimed at tech-savvy millennials and SME customers.
• Policy landscape – noted potential impacts of evolving trade and connectivity policies on our cost structure and the importance of staying engaged on industry advocacy.

Let me know if you’d like any additional details or clarification.

Best,
John
