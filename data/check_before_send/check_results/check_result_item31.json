  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nThank you for reaching out. Below is a concise overview of the most actionable customer insights we have gathered recently that should help shape the upcoming campaign. All figures are rounded and presented at an aggregated level so we keep individual customer data confidential.\n\n1. Who is banking with us today\n\u2022 Younger Professionals (\u2248 ages mid-20s to mid-30s) \u2013 represent the fastest-growing segment of new account openings. They are highly mobile-first and respond best to messages about speed, convenience and budgeting tools.\n\u2022 Established Families (\u2248 ages late-30s to mid-50s) \u2013 largest share of total deposits. They value relationship-based offerings (e.g., bundled checking + mortgage rate discounts) and respond well to content that stresses trust, long-term security and financial planning.\n\u2022 Savers Nearing Retirement \u2013 smaller in number but hold a significant portion of total assets under management. They are very attentive to safety, yield and personal advice.\n\n2. Product & channel trends we\u2019ve observed\n\u2022 Mobile-app adoption climbed by low-double-digits over the last annual cycle; nearly three-quarters of new customers now activate the app within their first week.\n\u2022 Demand for high-interest savings products has outpaced that for standard checking, particularly among the Younger Professional cohort.\n\u2022 Short-form video and interactive calculators are our top-performing creative formats on paid social; click-through rates there run roughly 2\u00d7 higher than static ads.\n\u2022 E-mail remains the best driver of cross-sell into credit cards for Established Families, especially when personalised with spending category insights.\n\n3. Motivators & pain points gathered from recent surveys\n\u2022 Convenience: Customers cite \u201ceverything in one app\u201d as a primary reason for choosing us over regional competitors.\n\u2022 Transparency on fees: Clear, jargon-free explanations strongly influence switching decisions.\n\u2022 Financial-wellness tools: Budget tracking and goal-setting dashboards receive high satisfaction scores and are a key retention lever.\n\u2022 Pain points: Lengthy in-branch wait times and uncertainty around loan approval timelines are still the main detractors mentioned.\n\n4. Recommended angles for the joint campaign\n\u2022 Highlight the frictionless digital journey \u2013 quick account set-up, intuitive budgeting and card controls in-app.\n\u2022 Pair that with trust-building proof points (FDIC insurance, local support teams, long-standing community involvement) to reassure more risk-averse segments.\n\u2022 Consider a two-track creative approach:\n   \u2013 Mobile-first, high-energy visuals & lifestyle messaging for Younger Professionals.\n   \u2013 Warm, stability-oriented storytelling featuring real customer scenarios for the Family & Pre-Retirement audiences.\n\nIf you\u2019d like deeper detail on any of the above or need supporting statistics, let me know and I can provide a more granular breakdown under NDA.\n\nI\u2019ll keep an eye out for any further context you send over and am happy to jump on a call if that helps fine-tune the plan.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\nCustomer-Service Department\nFirst Trust Bank",
