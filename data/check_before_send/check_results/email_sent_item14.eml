Hi [Your Name],

Thank you for requesting an update on OptiLife’s requirements for the HealthHub platform. Below is the latest consolidated overview:

1. Seamless Integration
   • Single sign-on (SSO) with OptiLife’s existing employee portal.
   • Secure data exchange with our wellness program database.

2. Core Functionality
   • Individual goal tracking for steps, nutrition, mindfulness minutes, etc.
   • Personalized insights and recommendations based on aggregated program data.
   • Company-wide, team, and individual wellness challenges with leaderboards and rewards.

3. Engagement & User Experience
   • Mobile-first responsive design.
   • Push/email notifications for reminders and challenge milestones.
   • Gamification elements (badges, points, streaks).

4. Reporting & Analytics
   • Real-time dashboards for program coordinators showing participation and completion rates.
   • Exportable summary reports (CSV/Excel) for quarterly reviews.

5. Security & Compliance
   • HIPAA-compliant data handling.
   • Role-based access controls separating employee view from admin analytics.

6. Scalability & Support
   • Capacity to add future modules such as mental-health resources.
   • Service-level agreement covering uptime, maintenance windows, and support response times.

Current Engagement Snapshot (Aggregate)
• ~70 % of employees join our 10k Steps Challenge.
• ~65 % participate in our Mindful March meditation series.
These figures guide our concurrency and engagement targets for HealthHub.

Please let me know if you need additional details or would like to schedule a follow-up call.

Best regards,

Jane
Health Program Coordinator
OptiLife Inc.
