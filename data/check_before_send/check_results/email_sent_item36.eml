Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out. I understand the concern that rumors can cause and I’m happy to share the information that is currently cleared for public distribution:

• TeamBoost Workshops – These company-wide sessions are continuing as planned and are open to all teams. Their aim is to strengthen collaboration and efficiency across the organization. You’ll receive a formal invitation with dates, times and sign-up details shortly.

At this point, there have been no other official or public announcements regarding structural or staffing changes. If anything is confirmed for broader release, HR will circulate the information right away so everyone has the same, accurate details.

I hope this helps put your mind at ease. Let me know if you have any other questions, and I’ll share what I can.

Best regards,
Jane
