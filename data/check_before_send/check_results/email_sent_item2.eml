Hi Emily,

It’s great to hear from you. Below is a concise framework I’ve found helpful when working with clients who present with clinically significant anxiety and/or panic:

1. Comprehensive Assessment
   • Rule-out medical contributors and substance effects.
   • Understand onset, maintaining factors, safety behaviors, and functional impairment.

2. Psychoeducation & Goal-Setting
   • Explain the fight/flight response and how avoidance reinforces fear.
   • Collaboratively identify measurable treatment goals and an exposure hierarchy.

3. Core CBT Interventions
   • Cognitive restructuring: identify automatic thoughts, evaluate evidence, develop balanced alternatives.
   • Graded exposure: gradual, systematic experiments that disconfirm catastrophic expectations.
   • Behavioral experiments & thought records to integrate cognitive and behavioral work.

4. Skills for Emotional & Physiological Regulation
   • Diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and paced exhalation.
   • Mindfulness-based attention training to reduce reactivity to anxious sensations.
   • Problem-solving and values-based action to counter experiential avoidance.

5. Lifestyle & Relapse-Prevention Components
   • Sleep hygiene, moderate caffeine/alcohol, regular aerobic activity.
   • Early-warning sign worksheet, scheduled booster sessions, and continued exposure practice.

6. Outcome Measurement
   • GAD-7, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and panic logs to track progress every few sessions.

Additional Resources
• Cognitive-Behavioral Techniques for Anxiety (Notion): practical step-by-step CBT exercises with sample case material.  
• Recommended Reading on Anxiety Disorders (Notion): a curated list of books and articles, including Clark & Beck’s “The Anxiety and Worry Workbook” and Greenberger & Padesky’s “Mind Over Mood.”

Feel free to explore those pages, and let me know if you’d like editing rights or a quick walkthrough. If you want to discuss specific cases or troubleshoot implementation challenges, we can set up a short supervision call.

Hope this helps, and I’m always happy to support your work at Greenleaf.

Best regards,
John
