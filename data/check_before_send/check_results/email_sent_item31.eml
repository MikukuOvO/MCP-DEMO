Hi Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out. Below is a concise overview of the most actionable customer insights we have gathered recently that should help shape the upcoming campaign. All figures are rounded and presented at an aggregated level so we keep individual customer data confidential.

1. Who is banking with us today
• Younger Professionals (≈ ages mid-20s to mid-30s) – represent the fastest-growing segment of new account openings. They are highly mobile-first and respond best to messages about speed, convenience and budgeting tools.
• Established Families (≈ ages late-30s to mid-50s) – largest share of total deposits. They value relationship-based offerings (e.g., bundled checking + mortgage rate discounts) and respond well to content that stresses trust, long-term security and financial planning.
• Savers Nearing Retirement – smaller in number but hold a significant portion of total assets under management. They are very attentive to safety, yield and personal advice.

2. Product & channel trends we’ve observed
• Mobile-app adoption climbed by low-double-digits over the last annual cycle; nearly three-quarters of new customers now activate the app within their first week.
• Demand for high-interest savings products has outpaced that for standard checking, particularly among the Younger Professional cohort.
• Short-form video and interactive calculators are our top-performing creative formats on paid social; click-through rates there run roughly 2× higher than static ads.
• E-mail remains the best driver of cross-sell into credit cards for Established Families, especially when personalised with spending category insights.

3. Motivators & pain points gathered from recent surveys
• Convenience: Customers cite “everything in one app” as a primary reason for choosing us over regional competitors.
• Transparency on fees: Clear, jargon-free explanations strongly influence switching decisions.
• Financial-wellness tools: Budget tracking and goal-setting dashboards receive high satisfaction scores and are a key retention lever.
• Pain points: Lengthy in-branch wait times and uncertainty around loan approval timelines are still the main detractors mentioned.

4. Recommended angles for the joint campaign
• Highlight the frictionless digital journey – quick account set-up, intuitive budgeting and card controls in-app.
• Pair that with trust-building proof points (FDIC insurance, local support teams, long-standing community involvement) to reassure more risk-averse segments.
• Consider a two-track creative approach:
   – Mobile-first, high-energy visuals & lifestyle messaging for Younger Professionals.
   – Warm, stability-oriented storytelling featuring real customer scenarios for the Family & Pre-Retirement audiences.

If you’d like deeper detail on any of the above or need supporting statistics, let me know and I can provide a more granular breakdown under NDA.

I’ll keep an eye out for any further context you send over and am happy to jump on a call if that helps fine-tune the plan.

Best regards,
John
