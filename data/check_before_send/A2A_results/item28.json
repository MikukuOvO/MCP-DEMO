He is recovering steadily, and his physicians are satisfied with his progress.  We expect that, provided he continues to improve at his current pace, he will be able to return to school shortly.\\n\\nReason for recent absences\\n\u2022 The absences were advised by his care team so he could rest, undergo monitoring, and avoid exposure to additional illnesses while his immune system was temporarily stressed.\\n\\nGuidance for school support\\n1. Allow flexible attendance for the next several weeks if he needs to leave early or rest at home on particularly tiring days.\\n2. Provide a quiet place where he can take brief rest breaks when he feels fatigued.\\n3. Permit extra time for assignments, tests, and transitions between classes.\\n4. Ensure that he has ready access to water and a nutritious snack as needed.\\n5. Adapt physical-education activities to low-impact options and let him self-pace.\\n6. If prolonged writing becomes difficult, allow use of a computer or a note-taker.\\n\\nThese suggestions are drawn from the general school-accommodation plan I keep for Ethan.  They should help him stay comfortable and engaged without overexertion.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you need any additional documentation or if the school requires formal paperwork.
