Overall, our clinicians appreciate the clean interface and the ease of navigating between patient profiles, scheduling, and documentation. Below are a few observations and suggestions that we believe would further improve efficiency and clinical utility:\\n\\n1. Flexible Scheduling Options\\n\u2022   Please consider adding custom repeat patterns (e.g., every Monday/Wednesday/Friday or bi-weekly) and support for multiple session types within the same calendar view. This would help us manage multi-disciplinary treatment plans where therapy frequencies and times vary from week to week.\\n\u2022   A built-in mechanism for quickly adjusting future sessions\u2014without having to delete and recreate them\u2014would save considerable time when care plans change.\\n\\n2. Medication & Treatment Plan Management\\n\u2022   It would be helpful if the medication module allowed for variable dosing schedules (morning/evening or tapered dosages) and could link directly to progress-note templates.\\n\u2022   Enabling notifications when a medication or therapy plan is modified would ensure that all care-team members stay informed in real time.\\n\\n3. Outcome Tracking & Analytics\\n\u2022   Our clinic has already observed measurable gains in patient outcomes since adopting the platform. Embedding simple analytics dashboards\u2014such as longitudinal graphs of assessment scores or attendance trends\u2014would let clinicians quantify progress without exporting data to external tools.\\n\\n4. Speed & Offline Reliability\\n\u2022   Page-load times are generally good, but larger files (e.g., attachments in progress notes) can cause brief delays. Caching or background uploads might mitigate this.\\n\u2022   Limited offline functionality (read-only at minimum) would be valuable when working in areas with unstable internet connections.\\n\\nWe appreciate your continued commitment to building tools that support high-quality, person-centered care. Please let me know if elaboration on any of the points above would be useful.\\n\\nThank you for your time and for collaborating with us on these improvements.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nJohn  \\nHarmony Health Clinic\",\"cc\":null,\"bcc\":null,\"sender\":null}"
