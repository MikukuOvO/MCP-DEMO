Please find the key steps below:\\\\n\\\\n1. Customer files a complaint via our online portal, phone, or in-person.\\\\n2. A unique case number is generated, and the customer is notified.\\\\n3. The dispute is reviewed by our specialist team to determine its validity.\\\\n4. If valid, we contact the merchant for their response. For example, in the recent case with Glamour Gadgets, we reached out to the merchant regarding the credit card holder's disputed transaction of $4,500. Despite their history of customer complaints, we followed our standard protocol.\\\\n5. We evaluate the merchant's response and customer's claim to make a decision. In the Glamour Gadgets case, after reviewing the transaction details and the customer's evidence, we concluded the charge was indeed erroneous.\\\\n6. The customer is informed of the resolution, and if necessary, a refund is processed. The credit card holder in the Glamour Gadgets case was fully refunded the disputed amount.\\\\n\\\\nThis process ensures that all disputes are handled fairly and promptly. Let me know if you need further details.\\\\n\\\\nBest,  \\\\nJane Doe\\\\n\\\"\\n}\",\"annotations\":null}"

Below is an overview of Union Trust Bank\u2019s dispute resolution process that you\u2019re welcome to reference in your article. I\u2019ve also added a few contextual notes about consumer protections that guide our approach.\\n\\nUnion Trust Bank \u2013 Dispute Resolution Process (High-Level)\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n1. Complaint Initiation\\n   \u2022 Customers can open a dispute through our secure online portal, by phone, or in person at any branch.\\n   \u2022 An acknowledgement e-mail or letter is automatically generated, confirming receipt and providing a unique case number for tracking.\\n\\n2. Preliminary Review & Assignment\\n   \u2022 A customer-care specialist performs an initial assessment to ensure we have enough information to proceed.\\n   \u2022 The case is assigned to the appropriate investigations team (card, deposit, loan, or digital-banking).\\n\\n3. Investigation Phase\\n   \u2022 Investigators gather evidence from the customer, relevant internal records, the merchant (when applicable), and card networks.\\n   \u2022 Throughout the investigation we follow the timelines set out in Regulation E (Electronic Fund Transfer Act) for deposit accounts and Regulation Z (Truth in Lending Act) for credit cards, as well as CFPB guidance.\\n   \u2022 For card disputes, a provisional credit may be issued to the customer in accordance with these regulations while the review is ongoing.\\n\\n4. Decision & Customer Notification\\n   \u2022 Once all documentation has been assessed, the customer receives a written outcome explaining the findings and any actions taken (e.g., charge reversal, account correction, or explanation of why the transaction stands).\\n   \u2022 If financial remediation is required, credits are posted to the customer\u2019s account promptly after the decision is made.\\n\\n5. Escalation & Further Review\\n   \u2022 If the customer is not satisfied, they may request an internal appeal that is handled by our Dispute Resolution Review Committee.\\n   \u2022 Beyond our internal process, customers can escalate matters to the financial ombudsman service or file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\\n\\nConsumer-Protection Principles We Follow\\n---------------------------------------\\n\u2022 Transparency \u2013 clear communication at every stage; access to case-status updates online.\\n\u2022 Timeliness \u2013 regulatory deadlines guide our internal service-level objectives.\\n\u2022 Impartiality \u2013 investigations are handled by staff who were not involved in the original transaction.\\n\u2022 Data Security \u2013 all evidence and correspondence are stored in encrypted case-management systems.\\n\\nI hope this gives you the detail you need, but please let me know if any additional clarification would be helpful. I\u2019m happy to answer follow-up questions or provide publicly available statistics on dispute volumes and resolution times, if that would support your piece.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nJane Doe\\nCustomer Service Representative\\nUnion Trust Bank\\n\"}"
