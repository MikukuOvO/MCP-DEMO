  "email_content": "Hi Emily,\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful to hear from you! Thanks for asking about my work life at Sterling & Locke\u2014 I\u2019m happy to share a glimpse of a typical day.\n\nMost mornings start with a quick review of client portfolios so that I\u2019m up-to-date on any overnight market moves. After that, our team usually huddles to talk through current trends and decide where we should focus our attention for the day.  \n\nMid-day is a mix of preparing financial statements and tackling whatever questions land in my inbox. I really enjoy the puzzle-solving side of accounting\u2014 there\u2019s something satisfying about turning a box of receipts and spreadsheets into a clear story a client can act on.\n\nLater in the afternoon I\u2019ll often meet with clients to walk them through results or help them navigate new regulations. One of my favourite recent moments was helping a small family-owned caf\u00e9 understand a set of changing tax rules; watching their relief when everything finally clicked was priceless.\n\nBy early evening I\u2019m wrapping up notes and sketching out goals for the next day. It can be busy, but I like the balance of analysis, teamwork, and direct client interaction.\n\nEnough about me\u2014 how are things on your side of the world? Have you tried any new local dishes lately, or discovered a new hobby? I always love hearing your stories.\n\nLooking forward to your reply!\n\nWarm regards,\nJane",
