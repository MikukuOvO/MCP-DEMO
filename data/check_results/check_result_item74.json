Let me know if any early observations stand out or if you need anything additional.\n\nNext Steps & Timeline:\n\u2022 Over the next few weeks we\u2019ll finalize the bottleneck analysis and start drafting recommendations.\n\u2022 Once we have the initial findings, I propose we schedule a brief call to align on the paper structure and division of sections.\n\nPlease share any feedback or questions whenever convenient. Thanks for your continued collaboration!\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]",
