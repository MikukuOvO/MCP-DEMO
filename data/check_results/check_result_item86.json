The release resolves the recent issues in the transaction-processing module and adds stronger data-storage encryption. It\u2019s now ready for your review and integration testing on the client side.\n\n\u2022 After your integration work is complete, Jane will wrap up the remaining encryption-related bug fixes so we can move on to full QA.\n\nLet me know if you need anything else or would like to discuss further.\n\nThanks!\n\n[Your Name]",
