  "email_content": "Dear Carlos,\n\nThank you for reaching out. Since your message, there have been a couple of noteworthy developments that may be helpful for the Havenbrook Immigrant Alliance as you prepare for the upcoming community meeting:\n\n\u2022 Visa quotas for skilled workers have been expanded, which should shorten wait times for certain employment-based categories.\n\n\u2022 A new temporary protection status is being introduced for individuals from countries experiencing significant political unrest; the exact eligibility criteria are still being finalized, but early guidance suggests humanitarian considerations will be prioritized.\n\nWe are also tracking potential adjustments to family-based petitions, but no concrete changes have been published yet. I will share details as soon as they become available.\n\nIn the meantime, I recommend that community members who think they might qualify under the new provisions begin gathering their documentation so they can act quickly once the official guidance is released. During the upcoming meeting, we can walk through practical next steps and point people toward reputable, low-cost or pro-bono legal resources.\n\nPlease let me know if there are specific concerns you\u2019d like me to address in more depth.\n\nBest regards,\nJane",
