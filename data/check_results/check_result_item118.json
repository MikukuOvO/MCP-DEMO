It feels like ages since our last letter, so I wanted to reach out and catch up.\n\nLife on my side has been busy but good. Work at the rehabilitation center keeps me on my toes, yet it\u2019s rewarding to see positive changes unfolding little by little. Outside of work I\u2019ve been trying to carve out time for reading and short weekend hikes\u2014small escapes that always recharge me.\n\nHow have things been for you lately? How is the university going, and what projects are you most excited about right now? I\u2019d love to hear about any new caf\u00e9s you\u2019ve discovered or trips you have planned for the warmer months.\n\nLet\u2019s try not to let so much time pass before the next update! Whenever you have a free moment, send a quick hello and let me know how you\u2019re doing.\n\nUn abrazo desde aqu\u00ed,\n[Your Name]",
