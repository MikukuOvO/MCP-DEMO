I wanted to share a brief status update on our community and on Path to Sobriety\u2019s recent activities:\n\n\u2022 Community engagement continues to grow. Attendance at our weekly support meetings has increased noticeably over the past several weeks, showing stronger participation and interest.\n\n\u2022 Over the last month Path to Sobriety has:\n  \u2013 Connected individually with dozens of community members who expressed interest in recovery resources.\n  \u2013 Hosted several substance-abuse awareness workshops that were well received by participants and local partners.\n  \u2013 Helped a number of new participants begin their rehabilitation journeys, reflecting steady program impact.\n\nOverall, momentum is positive, and community response remains encouraging.
