  "email_content": "Hi Michael,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I wanted to share a quick roundup of where things stand with the families we\u2019re working with together:\n\n\u2022 Thompson family \u2013 They have now been placed in stable housing and are settling in. No immediate follow-ups needed on the housing front, but I\u2019ll keep an eye on any longer-term support they may request.\n\n\u2022 Rivera family \u2013 Enrollment in the food-assistance program is complete. The first delivery is scheduled, and I\u2019ll confirm that everything arrives smoothly.\n\n\u2022 Green family \u2013 Their application for medical aid is still under review. I\u2019ll let you know as soon as we receive a decision, and we can coordinate next steps if additional documentation is requested.\n\nLet me know if you need any more detail or if there\u2019s anything else I can help with on your side.\n\nThanks for your partnership, and speak soon!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
