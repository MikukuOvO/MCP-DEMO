I wanted to share a quick update on this year\u2019s admissions cycle:\n\n\u2022 Interest continues to climb \u2013 applications rose modestly to just over fifteen thousand.\n\u2022 Selectivity remains high, with offers extended to roughly one in fourteen applicants.\n\u2022 The incoming class is our most academically accomplished yet, with average standardized scores in the high-1400s (SAT) / low-30s (ACT).\n\u2022 We\u2019re also welcoming students from more than sixty countries, adding wonderful depth to the community\u2019s diversity.\n\nIt\u2019s shaping up to be an energetic, talented cohort, and we\u2019re already planning a range of orientation and mentorship activities to help them settle in.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or would like to get involved with alumni outreach for the new class.\n\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name]",
