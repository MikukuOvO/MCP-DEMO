  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nThanks for reaching out! I\u2019ve pulled together an overview of our most recent donor-engagement results to help with planning the upcoming joint campaign.\n\n\u2022 Overall trajectory \u2013 We\u2019ve seen steady, year-over-year growth in both the number of active donors and total contributions. Engagement has strengthened consistently for the past three cycles.\n\n\u2022 Stand-out strategies \u2013 Personalized outreach (hand-written notes, tailored emails) and matching-gift promotions continue to drive the best response rates. These tactics deliver the greatest lift in both participation and gift size.\n\n\u2022 Seasonal insights \u2013 The final quarter of our last fiscal year produced a noticeable spike, particularly during the holiday period. A focused email series to prior supporters proved especially effective in re-activating lapsed donors.\n\n\u2022 Next steps \u2013 I\u2019m happy to share a slide deck with additional charts or set up a short call to walk through the findings and brainstorm how we can incorporate the most effective elements into our joint campaign.\n\nLet me know what would be most helpful, and I\u2019ll get it over to you.\n\nBest,\nJohn",
