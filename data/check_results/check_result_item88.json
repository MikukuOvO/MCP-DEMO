I\u2019ve been reviewing our recent brainstorming notes and wanted to share a few ideas on how we can strengthen our fundraising impact this year.\n\nKey opportunities we\u2019ve identified:\n\u2022 Encourage recurring giving by making monthly support the default option on campaign pages.\n\u2022 Enhance donor recognition through timely thank-you messages and public appreciation posts.\n\u2022 Launch engaging social-media challenges to mobilize younger supporters.\n\u2022 Host creative virtual or hybrid events, such as:\n  \u2013 A community fitness challenge or virtual marathon\n  \u2013 An online concert featuring local talent\n  \u2013 A neighborhood art auction with proceeds supporting our programs\n\u2022 Partner with local businesses for matching gifts or in-kind contributions.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear what initiatives Community United is planning and explore how we might collaborate.
