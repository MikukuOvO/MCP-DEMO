  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I\u2019m excited about moving forward with our joint initiative between Helping Hands Alliance and our organization. Based on our earlier discussions, we\u2019re aiming to provide counseling services supported by trained volunteers.\n\nTo keep things on track, could we:\n\u2022 Finalize the combined volunteer list from both teams.\n\u2022 Identify preferred dates for the first round of training sessions.\n\u2022 Discuss how best-practice insights from previous counseling work can be integrated into the training materials.\n\nWould you be available for a brief call early next week to review these points and confirm our timeline? If another time suits you better, just let me know.\n\nLooking forward to collaborating and making a positive impact together.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
