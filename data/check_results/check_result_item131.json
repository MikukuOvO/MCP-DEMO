  "email_content": "Dear Sarah,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I wanted to provide a brief update on our student volunteer\u2019s continued involvement with Helping Hands Foundation.\n\nOver the past several weeks, the student has been actively engaged in a range of outreach activities. Foundation team members have shared very positive feedback, noting the student\u2019s punctuality, initiative, and supportive attitude toward fellow volunteers. They frequently arrive early to help with set-up, stay afterward to wrap up, and step in wherever assistance is needed.\n\nThe student is enthusiastic about maintaining this commitment and is eager to keep contributing in the months ahead. Please let me know if there are any upcoming projects or particular areas where the foundation could use additional help, and we\u2019ll be happy to coordinate.\n\nThank you for all that you and your team do.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
