Early feedback on the polished draft has been very positive.\n\n\u2022 Next Steps \u2013 I\u2019m now coordinating with the cover-design team and outlining the launch timeline to keep the release on track.\n\n\u2022 Bandwidth \u2013 With that manuscript wrapped up, I have room to take on new assignments. Please let me know if there are any initiatives where I can help.\n\nThank you for your continued support, and let me know if you\u2019d like additional details.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]",
