  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nThanks for your note\u2014I\u2019m excited to support the campaign.\n\nBelow is a concise snapshot of recent customer behaviour and preferences that may help shape the creative and channel strategy:\n\n1. Mobile-First Younger Segment (approx. 18\u201330)\n   \u2022 We continue to see double-digit month-over-month growth in mobile banking usage (just over 20% last month).\n   \u2022 Popular actions: mobile cheque deposit, online bill pay and peer-to-peer transfers.\n   \u2022 Suggested creative angle: emphasise speed, 24/7 convenience and easy money-management tools.\n\n2. Relationship-Focused Middle Segment (approx. 40\u201355)\n   \u2022 Branch visits rose roughly 15% over the same period.\n   \u2022 These customers highlight friendly, informed staff as a key differentiator and often ask for extended weekend hours.\n   \u2022 Suggested creative angle: spotlight personal service, trust and access to knowledgeable advisors; consider promotions tied to in-branch consultations.\n\n3. Growth Opportunity Segment (approx. 30\u201345)\n   \u2022 This group drove the largest share of new account openings last quarter.\n   \u2022 Products drawing attention include high-yield savings and automated budgeting tools.\n   \u2022 Suggested creative angle: position the bank as a partner in achieving medium-term financial goals.\n\n4. Pain-Points & Quick Wins\n   \u2022 Some users have reported intermittent glitches when moving funds between internal accounts via the app.\n   \u2022 Several customers would like a more detailed transaction history within the app for easier spending analysis.\n   \u2022 Addressing these items in product messaging (or release notes) could reinforce a customer-centric narrative.\n\nSummary\nCo-ordinated messaging that pairs mobile convenience with human expertise appears to resonate across segments: \u201cdigital when you want it, personal when you need it.\u201d If helpful, I can pull deeper dives on specific geographies or product lines\u2014just let me know.\n\nLooking forward to collaborating.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn",
