  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nAs promised, here\u2019s a concise overview of the key points for the Q2 budget forecast:\n\n\u2022 We anticipate a moderate increase in raw-material costs driven by current market volatility.\n\u2022 Updated price lists have been negotiated with our main suppliers and should serve as the baseline for upcoming procurement planning.\n\u2022 A planned shift toward more sustainable materials is expected to raise unit costs slightly in the near term but aligns with our long-term strategy.\n\u2022 Detailed line-item figures, supplier breakdowns, and supporting spreadsheets are available in the shared drive/Notion workspace. Let me know if you need access or a walk-through.\n\nPlease review these points and let me know if there\u2019s anything else you need before we finalize the forecast.\n\nThanks,\n[Your Name]",
