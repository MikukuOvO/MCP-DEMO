  "email_content": "Hi Team,\n\nI hope you're doing well. I wanted to share a quick overview of some upcoming changes to our workplace and processes:\n\nOffice environment:\n\u2022 Renovations are scheduled to begin next week on the ground floor, focusing on the common work areas and break room.\n\u2022 During the renovation, workstations will be moved to the upper floors. Facilities will post floor maps and signage to help everyone settle in.\n\u2022 We anticipate this phase lasting a few weeks. We'll keep you posted on progress and any adjustments to the timeline.\n\nWorkflow:\n\u2022 We\u2019re rolling out AgileBoost, a refreshed workflow that emphasizes shorter iterations, cross-functional collaboration, and flexibility.\n\u2022 Over the next sprint, each team will receive a brief orientation and resources to help transition smoothly.\n\u2022 Please share feedback as you begin working within the new framework so we can continuously improve.\n\nNext steps:\n\u2022 Check the #office-updates Slack channel for renovation progress, seating charts, and FAQs.\n\u2022 Look out for calendar invites to the AgileBoost intro sessions.\n\u2022 If you have questions or run into blockers, feel free to reach out to Facilities (for environment) or the PMO (for workflow).\n\nThanks for your cooperation and adaptability.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn",
