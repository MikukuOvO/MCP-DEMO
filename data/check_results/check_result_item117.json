Below are a few Greenfield University alumni highlights that may be useful for your feature:\n\n\u2022 Marcus Antonelli \u2013 An honors graduate who recently delivered the keynote address at our annual alumni gathering. Marcus is also an active volunteer, regularly supporting local non-profit initiatives and mentoring current students.\n\n\u2022 Community-Focused Volunteering \u2013 Across the alumni community, many graduates have been spearheading volunteer projects that benefit regional education and youth programs. Participation rates have grown steadily over the past year, reflecting our graduates\u2019 strong commitment to service.\n\n\u2022 Recent Alumni Events \u2013 Our latest networking reception attracted a diverse group of graduates working in fields such as technology, public policy, and healthcare. Panels emphasized innovation, career resilience, and giving back to the university community.\n\nI hope these points help illustrate the impact Greenfield alumni are making.
