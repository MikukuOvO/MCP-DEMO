He usually gets a couple of mid-week days off, so aiming for one of those should boost our chances of catching him free.\n\n\u2022 Venue: It may be easier to host the get-together at a neutral spot rather than his place, which will help keep everything under wraps and avoid any schedule conflicts.\n\n\u2022 Gift idea: A rugged smartwatch made for first responders could be a great fit \u2013 practical and thoughtful.\n\nLet me know what you think and how I can assist with the next steps.\n\nBest,\nJane",
