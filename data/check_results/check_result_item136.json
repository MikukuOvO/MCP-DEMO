  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nThank you for reaching out about the current needs we\u2019re seeing in the community. Here\u2019s a brief overview based on our most recent assessments:\n\n\u2022 Food security \u2013 Demand for food assistance has grown by roughly one-fifth in recent months, so non-perishable staples and fresh-produce vouchers are high-priority.\n\n\u2022 Mental-health support \u2013 We\u2019re seeing a noticeable rise in requests for affordable counseling and peer-support groups. Additional volunteer counselors or funding for mental-health programming would make a meaningful difference.\n\n\u2022 Addiction recovery \u2013 Community members continue to stress the importance of accessible recovery resources and family-oriented support services.\n\nIf Hope & Aid is in a position to boost any of these areas\u2014especially food-distribution logistics or expanding counseling sessions\u2014I\u2019d be glad to discuss details and coordinate efforts.\n\nThank you for your partnership and all that you do.\n\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name]",
