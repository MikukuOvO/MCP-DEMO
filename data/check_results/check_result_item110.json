  "email_content": "Hi Alex,\n\nHope you\u2019re doing well. As requested, below is a concise outline of the key technical specifications from the IT side so that Marketing and IT stay aligned on the cross-departmental project.\n\n1. Data Integration\n   \u2022 A secure REST API (JSON) will be used for daily data exchanges between Marketing\u2019s analytics platform and the central data warehouse.\n   \u2022 All traffic will be encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest.\n   \u2022 Authentication is handled via service accounts with rotating tokens (SSO-compliant).\n\n2. Data Schema & Volume\n   \u2022 Primary tables: campaign_overview, customer_events, attribution_metrics.\n   \u2022 Expected daily volume: ~2 GB compressed; retention target: 24 months in the warehouse.\n   \u2022 Identifiers are pseudonymised before they leave source systems to meet internal privacy standards.\n\n3. Analytics Platform Connection\n   \u2022 IT will expose a pre-built connector for InSight360 (the analytics tool Marketing selected).\n   \u2022 Initial load will be performed in a staging environment; after validation, a promotion script moves assets to production.\n\n4. Security & Compliance\n   \u2022 Role-based access controls map to Marketing-Analyst, Marketing-Manager and Admin profiles.\n   \u2022 All queries are audited; logs retained for 12 months.\n   \u2022 The solution complies with our internal Data Protection Policy (ref. DP-3.1).\n\n5. Environments & Timeline\n   \u2022 Staging resources are available now; production cut-over is planned for early next quarter, pending user acceptance testing.\n   \u2022 A change-control ticket will be submitted one week before go-live.\n\n6. Support & Next Steps\n   \u2022 Dedicated IT contact: systems-integration@tritondefense.com\n   \u2022 Please let me know if you\u2019d like a brief walkthrough; I\u2019m happy to set up a joint call next week.\n\nLet me know if anything needs clarification or if you have additional requirements.\n\nLooking forward to moving this ahead together.\n\nBest,\nJane",
