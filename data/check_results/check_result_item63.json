  "email_content": "Dear Dr. Smith,\n\nI hope you are well. I am writing to share a concise overview of our most recent insights into how passengers perceive public spaces, based on the latest round of surveys and interviews.\n\nKey themes emerging from the data include:\n\u2022 Stress at security checkpoints: Many passengers described the process as anxiety-inducing and expressed a strong preference for more human-centred, empathetic interactions.\n\u2022 Respect for privacy and dignity: Respondents want screening procedures that feel both efficient and considerate, with clear communication about what to expect.\n\u2022 Safety in less-monitored areas: Travellers highlighted concerns about personal safety in facilities such as restrooms and other secluded zones, reinforcing the need for well-lit spaces, visible staff presence, and thoughtful design throughout the entire journey\u2014not just at primary checkpoints.\n\u2022 Calming environmental elements: Participants suggested that soothing lighting, soundscapes, and intuitive wayfinding could reduce stress and improve their overall sense of comfort.\n\nWe are compiling a more detailed report that expands on these findings and outlines design recommendations. In the meantime, please let me know if you would like any additional information or specific data break-downs.\n\nThank you for your continued collaboration. I look forward to your feedback and to discussing next steps.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\nPassenger Experience Research Group",
