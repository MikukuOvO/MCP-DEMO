I understand the uncertainty that can come with hearing snippets of news second-hand, so I\u2019m happy to give you a concise update.\n\n\u2022 Focus on growth and collaboration \u2013 Leadership is rolling out a new set of \u201cTeamBoost\u201d workshops aimed at improving cross-team communication and efficiency. You\u2019ll see invitations to the first sessions soon.\n\n\u2022 Talent development over reduction \u2013 Management has reiterated that the current initiatives are about up-skilling and scaling our capabilities, not downsizing. There are no workforce reductions tied to these changes.\n\n\u2022 More details ahead \u2013 A company-wide all-hands is being planned for early next quarter where leadership will outline the roadmap, answer questions, and highlight how each team fits into the broader plans.\n\nIn the meantime, your role and projects remain business-as-usual. If you\u2019d like to discuss any specific concerns, let me know and we can set up a quick chat.\n\nHope this helps clear things up.\n\nBest,\nJane",
