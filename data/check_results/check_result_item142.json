  "email_content": "Hi Michael,\n\nI just finished reading the latest draft and wanted to share a few quick thoughts:\n\n\u2022 The character development has taken a strong step forward. The central relationship feels nuanced and authentic, and I found myself really invested in their journeys.\n\n\u2022 The themes resonate more clearly, and several dialogue exchanges truly sparkle\u2014great work there!\n\n\u2022 One area you might revisit is the pacing in the final section. The narrative tension begins to loosen a bit toward the close; tightening a few transitional passages could help sustain momentum through the climax.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m impressed with the growth in this version and I\u2019m excited to see where you take it next. If you\u2019d like to talk through any of these points, let me know.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
