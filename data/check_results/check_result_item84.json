  "email_content": "Hi Maria,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I wanted to share a concise checklist of the next steps for the marketing campaign so we keep everything moving smoothly:\n\n1. Finalize the ad copy \u2013 aim to wrap this up in the first part of next month. The content team is polishing headlines and CTAs and will circulate a draft for your review.\n\n2. Secure media placements \u2013 shoot for confirmations around mid-month. If you need vendor contacts or past rate-card references, just let me know and I\u2019ll forward them.\n\n3. Schedule social-media posts \u2013 begin queuing posts so they can start rolling out later in the month once the creative assets are locked.\n\n4. Coordinate with Sales \u2013 let\u2019s arrange a brief sync to ensure their outreach messaging aligns with the campaign themes. I\u2019m happy to set up the meeting if helpful.\n\n5. Launch-event prep \u2013 the team is drafting the run-of-show and collateral so everything is ready for the product unveiling early next quarter. I\u2019ll keep you posted as soon as the first outline is ready.\n\nPlease let me know if I missed anything or if you\u2019d like additional detail on any of the above. Always happy to jump on a quick call or share supporting docs.\n\nThanks and talk soon,\nJohn",
