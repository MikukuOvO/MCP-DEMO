Together they seem to address both experiential avoidance and behavioral activation.\\n\\n\u2022 Preliminary Clinical Observations: Early sessions suggest clients experience fewer intrusive thoughts and report feeling more grounded when mindfulness exercises are combined with stepwise behavioral experiments. We\u2019ll continue tracking these trends systematically.\\n\\n\u2022 Protocol Development: We discussed drafting a pilot protocol that sequences mindfulness training in the first 2\u20133 sessions, followed by targeted behavioral interventions. Outcome measures could include standardized anxiety scales and daily practice logs.\\n\\n\u2022 Training Considerations: We may co-host a CPD webinar to walk colleagues through core MAA techniques, then demonstrate how to layer IBF components.\\n\\n\u2022 Research Angle: Possibility of a small N-of-1 series to gather initial efficacy data before pursuing a larger study.\\n\\nNext Steps:\\n1.
