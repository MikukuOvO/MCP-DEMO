The Privacy Rule requires a covered entity to treat a \"personal representative\" the same as the individual, with respect to uses and disclosures of the individual's protected health information, as well as the individual's rights under the Rule.84 A personal representative is a person legally authorized to make health care decisions on an individual's behalf or to act for a deceased individual or the estate. The Privacy Rule permits an exception when a\ncovered entity has a reasonable belief that the personal representative may be abusing or neglecting the individual, or that treating the person as the personal representative could otherwise endanger the individual.\n\nSpecial Case: Minors. In most cases, parents are the personal representatives for their minor children. Therefore, in most cases, parents can exercise individual rights, such as access to the medical record, on behalf of their minor children. In certain exceptional cases, the parent is not considered the personal representative. In these situations, the Privacy Rule defers to State and other law to determine the rights of parents to access and control the protected health information of their minor children. If State and other law is silent concerning parental access to the minor's protected health information, a covered entity has discretion to provide or deny a parent access to the minor's health information, provided the decision is made by a licensed health care professional in the exercise of professional judgment. See additional guidance on Personal Representatives."

The notices must describe in general terms the bank's information sharing practices.\nBanks that share nonpublic personal information about consumers with nonaffiliated third parties (outside of opt out exceptions delineated in the privacy rule) must also provide consumers with:\nan opt out notice\na reasonable period of time for the consumer to opt out\nA few key terms used throughout the privacy rule are critical to understanding the rule's scope and application. Refer to Section Four of this guide for an explanation of:\n\nnonpublic personal information\nthe distinction between consumers and customers\nnonaffiliated third party\nExceptions to opt out: A consumer cannot opt out of all information sharing. First, the privacy rule does not govern information sharing among affiliated parties. Second, the rule contains exceptions to allow transfers of nonpublic personal information to unaffiliated parties to process and service a consumer's transaction, and to facilitate other normal business transactions. For example, consumers cannot opt out when nonpublic personal information is shared with a nonaffiliated third party to:\n\nmarket the bank's own financial products or services\nmarket financial products or services offered by the bank and another financial institution (joint marketing)\nprocess and service transactions the consumer requests or authorizes\nprotect against potential fraud or unauthorized transactions\nrespond to judicial process\ncomply with federal, state, or local legal requirements\nApplying exceptions: A bank may have to satisfy disclosure and other requirements to make the rule's opt out exceptions applicable. For example, the joint marketing exception requires a contractual agreement between two nonaffiliated financial institutions to:\n\njointly offer, endorse, or sponsor the financial product or service, and\nlimit further use or disclosure of the consumer information transferred\nIn addition, the bank must include a separate statment in the privacy notice disclosing the joint marketing agreement.\n\nProhibition on sharing account numbers: The privacy rule prohibits a bank from disclosing an account number or access code for credit card, deposit, or transaction accounts to any nonaffiliated third party for use in marketing. The rule contains two narrow exceptions to this general prohibition. A bank may share account numbers in conjunction with marketing its own products as long as the service provider is not authorized to directly initiate charges to the accounts. A bank may also disclose account numbers to a participant in a private label or affinity credit card program when the participants are identified to the customer. An account number does not include a number or code in encrypted form as long as the bank does not also provide a means to decode the number.\n\nLimits on reuse and redisclosure: The privacy rule limits reuse and redisclosure of nonpublic personal information received from a nonaffiliated financial institution or disclosed to a nonaffiliated third party. The specific limitations depend on whether the information was received pursuant to or outside of the notice and opt out exceptions.\n\nState Law: A provision under a State law that provides greater consumer protection than provided under the GLBA privacy provisions will supercede the Federal privacy rule. The bank will be obligated to comply with the provisions of that State law to the extent those provisions provide greater consumer protection than the Federal privacy rule. The Federal Trade Commission determines whether a particular State law provides greater protection."

This information includes things like assessment results, grades, and demographic information. Teachers can ensure students\u2019 privacy by empowering them to share only the information they want and helping them understand how sharing their personal information can impact them. Confidentiality comes into play when private data is shared. Students trust their teachers to keep their data confidential and share it carefully. Teachers are responsible for holding every student\u2019s data in confidence and sharing it only with necessary parties such as parents, other teachers, and administrators. Finally, teachers can keep student data both private and confidential by establishing clear security practices in their classrooms. They may consider things such as how and where they share student data and how this data is accessed.\n\nTeachers need to understand how privacy, security, and confidentiality apply to their work in the classroom, specifically the data they gather. Teachers gather and analyze data about students all year and in many ways, including anecdotal notes, test results, grades, and observations. Given the use of cloud-based tools responsive to student progress, how teachers gather and use that data is rapidly changing. Teachers should therefore consider the variety of data they gather in their classrooms:\n\n\nConsider, for these different types of data, all of the moments in which educators need to prioritize student privacy. It may be a matter of keeping a student\u2019s name, password, or parent information private, or maybe assessment results and grades need to be kept confidential. Teachers should also prioritize student security when handling login information or passwords. Only when teachers are aware of these different types of data in their classrooms can they make thoughtful data privacy decisions."

However, there are some areas that could be improved for efficiency. For instance, the medication scheduling module does not allow for custom repeat patterns which are essential for patients with complex needs. Specifically, for a patient under our care, their behavioral therapy sessions include a combination of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) three times a week, Speech Therapy twice a week, and Occupational Therapy once a week. Their medication regimen consists of a morning dose of Risperidone to manage irritability and a nightly dose of Melatonin to aid with sleep. These require flexible scheduling options to accommodate changes in therapy times and medication dosages based on ongoing assessments and needs. The current system's lack of customization prevents us from efficiently managing these aspects of their care. Additionally, the system could benefit from incorporating analytics on patient improvement rates. Our clinic has observed a 20% improvement in patient outcomes since the implementation of the new system, which is promising. We are sharing this feedback with you as a third-party vendor to consider these improvements.\"}]}",
