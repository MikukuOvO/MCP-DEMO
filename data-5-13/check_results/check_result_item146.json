This should give your team the information needed to begin detailed planning on your side.\n\nPROJECT MILESTONES\n\u2022 Initial system design completed by March 15, 2022  \n\u2022 First prototype ready for internal testing by June 1, 2022  \n\u2022 Final system implementation targeted for September 30, 2022\n\nDATA SECURITY PROTOCOLS\n\u2022 All data transmissions will be encrypted using AES-256  \n\u2022 Quarterly security audits will be scheduled to ensure continued compliance  \n\u2022 Access to sensitive data will be restricted through role-based permissions and logging\n\nUSER INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS\n\u2022 An intuitive dashboard for health-service officers  \n\u2022 Real-time data analytics visible on the main interface  \n\u2022 Customizable report generation for key health metrics\n\nNEXT STEPS\n1. Please confirm that the proposed milestone dates align with your development capacity.  \n2. Identify the primary points of contact for project management, security, and engineering.  \n3. Review the above security approach and let us know if any additional controls are recommended.  \n4. Suggest two or three time slots for a virtual kickoff meeting within the next two weeks.\n\nOnce we have an executed NDA in place, I will provide the detailed functional specifications and a small set of de-identified sample data for your engineering team.\n\nThank you for your partnership. I look forward to working closely with you to deliver a secure and user-friendly health-tracking system.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJane Doe\nMetro Health Authority\njane.doe@gmail.com | +1-555-123-4567",
