  "email_content": "Subject: Overview of Our CPS Procedures & Current Challenges\n\nHi Alex,\n\nThank you for reaching out and for the care you bring to investigative work on child-welfare issues. Below is a concise overview of how Haven Child Welfare\u2019s Child Protective Services (CPS) unit operates, along with the principal challenges we face and the steps we are taking to address them.\n\nCPS PROCEDURES (AT A GLANCE)\n1. Intake & Screening  \n   \u2022 24/7 hotline triages every report.  \n   \u2022 Imminent-danger calls trigger an in-person response within 24 hours (often same day).\n\n2. Initial Assessment  \n   \u2022 Caseworker visits the home (statutory window: 24\u201372 hrs) and interviews the child, caregivers, and collateral contacts.  \n   \u2022 Structured Decision-Making (SDM) tools help quantify safety and risk.\n\n3. Safety Planning  \n   \u2022 If risk is substantiated, a safety plan is developed\u2014ranging from in-home supports to court-ordered removal.  \n   \u2022 Court review occurs within 72 hrs when removal is involved.\n\n4. Ongoing Services & Monitoring  \n   \u2022 Multidisciplinary team coordinates services (mental-health, substance-use, parenting, etc.) and meets at least every 30 days to review progress.\n\n5. Permanency & Case Closure  \n   \u2022 Primary goal: reunification when safe. Concurrent planning for kinship placement, guardianship, or adoption, in line with ASFA timelines.  \n   \u2022 Cases close when the SDM tool and supervisory review show risk is mitigated.\n\nKEY CHALLENGES\n\u2022 High caseloads: Average of 28\u201332 open cases per worker (vs. the 12\u201315 recommended by Child Welfare League of America).  \n\u2022 Limited resources: Shortage of foster placements for teens/sibling groups, and wait-lists for trauma-informed counseling and bilingual providers.  \n\u2022 Workforce retention & wellbeing: ~22 % annual turnover; secondary trauma is significant. We just launched peer-support groups and on-call counseling.  \n\u2022 Inter-agency coordination: Data and scheduling gaps across law enforcement, schools, and courts can slow decision-making.  \n\u2022 Policy & funding shifts: New mandates under the Family First Prevention Services Act require evidence-based programs while federal/state funding remains flat.\n\nHOW WE\u2019RE RESPONDING\n\u2022 Piloting an AI-enabled transcription tool that trims paperwork time by ~20 %.  \n\u2022 Expanding our Kinship Navigator program\u2014adding 40 kinship beds this fiscal year.  \n\u2022 Seeking philanthropic support to underwrite staff wellness and retention bonuses.  \n\u2022 Publishing quarterly aggregate data dashboards (first release: July).\n\nNEXT STEPS / ACCESS\nWe value transparency and can provide:  \n\u2022 Policy manuals and redacted case examples (aggregate only).  \n\u2022 Interviews with front-line supervisors and, when families give explicit consent, with parents or youth.  \n\u2022 Observation of a multidisciplinary team meeting (with identities protected).\n\nLet me know the specific angles you\u2019re investigating or any data points you\u2019d like. I\u2019m available for a 20-minute call Tuesday\u2013Thursday, 10 a.m.\u20132 p.m. ET, and can arrange a longer sit-down interview thereafter.\n\nThanks again for your interest in protecting children and improving the system designed to serve them.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \nDirector of Communications | Haven Child Welfare Agency  \n[Direct line] | [Email]",
