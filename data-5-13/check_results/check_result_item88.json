  "email_content": "Hi Emily,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. Over the past few weeks I\u2019ve been gathering ideas on how we can further strengthen Community United\u2019s donation pipeline and wanted to share a few actionable concepts that surfaced:\n\n1. Grow recurring giving \u2013 making monthly contributions the default option and highlighting the long-term impact for donors.\n2. Launch a refreshed donor-recognition program \u2013 tiered acknowledgements, impact stories, and a simple \u201cthank-you\u201d microsite.\n3. Roll out a social-media challenge aimed at younger supporters to expand reach and generate peer-to-peer momentum.\n4. Expand digital channels \u2013 crowdfunding integrations and the option to accept crypto or contactless/pay-app gifts.\n5. Partner with local businesses for in-kind matches and community spotlights.\n\nThese align closely with the priorities we noted in the recent donation-strategy meeting (recurring gifts, stronger recognition, and creative social engagement) and build on the innovative approaches we discussed in our earlier emails.\n\nWould you have 30 minutes next week to dive into these ideas and map out a pilot plan? I\u2019m flexible Tuesday\u2013Thursday after 10 AM ET, but let me know what works best for you and I\u2019ll make it happen.\n\nLooking forward to collaborating!\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\n",
