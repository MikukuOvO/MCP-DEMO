  "email_content": "Dear Mr. Green,\n\nThank you for your message and for outlining your goals for the upcoming learning modules. We are happy to collaborate and appreciate your commitment to safeguarding student privacy.\n\nWe can provide an aggregated data set that includes:\n\u2022 Average test scores by subject for the 2024\u201325 academic year\n\u2022 Participation rates in key extracurricular activities\n\u2022 General trends in assignment completion and attendance\n\nNo personally identifiable student information will be shared. To ensure that both parties are aligned on privacy and usage, we ordinarily put a short Data-Sharing Agreement (DSA) in place that specifies:\n1. Data elements to be shared (aggregate only)\n2. Purpose and scope of use\n3. Retention period and secure-storage requirements\n4. Prohibition on re-identification or onward transfer\n\nA draft DSA is ready for your review; please let me know if you\u2019d like me to send it over. Once the agreement is signed, I can forward the \u201cLincoln High School Student Performance Report\u201d immediately and, if needed, schedule a brief call to walk through the data.\n\nIf the summary above meets your needs, just confirm and we can move forward. If you require any additional metrics, feel free to let me know so we can determine what is feasible while still protecting student privacy.\n\nLooking forward to working together.\n\nBest regards,\nJane Doe\nData & Assessment Coordinator\nLincoln High School\n",
