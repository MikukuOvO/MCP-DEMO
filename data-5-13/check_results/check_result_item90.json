I\u2019m excited about the momentum we\u2019re building around our upcoming joint initiative between Helping Hands Alliance and our team.\n\nWhere we stand:\n\u2022 Volunteer roster \u2013 we\u2019re close to finalizing the list but still need your confirmation on two additional counselors from your side.\n\u2022 Training schedule \u2013 I\u2019ve drafted a three-session outline (orientation, core counseling skills, and scenario-based practice). Tentative dates: June 3, 10 and 17, all at 10:00 AM.\n\u2022 Curriculum \u2013 we\u2019d like to fold in the general advice and best-practice notes your counselors already use so the sessions feel familiar for everyone.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Let me know if the above dates work for your team, or suggest alternatives.\n2. Please send over the short bios for your two remaining volunteers so we can include them in the orientation packet.\n3. If you have any training materials you\u2019d like incorporated, feel free to share them by the end of next week.\n\nWould you be available for a quick 30-minute check-in call early next week to lock these items down? I\u2019m free Monday (May 19) at 11:00 AM or Wednesday (May 21) at 3:00 PM. Let me know what suits you best.\n\nThanks, Mark\u2014I\u2019m looking forward to working together to make this program a success for the community!\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Position / Organization]\n[Contact Information]",
