  "email_content": "Hi Alex,\n\nIt was great meeting you the other day and hearing about your interest in addiction recovery. As promised, here\u2019s a snapshot of what we do at Serenity Path Recovery Center and a few ways you could plug in if you\u2019d like.\n\nWhat we do\n-----------\n\u2022 Whole-person treatment \u2013 We combine medical detox, evidence\u2013based therapies (CBT, DBT, 12-Step facilitation) and holistic practices like mindfulness, yoga and nutrition coaching.\n\u2022 Multiple program tracks \u2013 In-patient residential (28\u201390 days), Intensive Out-patient, evening Out-patient groups, and stand-alone individual & family counseling make it possible for people to get help without pausing their entire life.\n\u2022 Family focus \u2013 Loved ones are invited into weekly sessions so everyone learns the same communication and relapse-prevention skills.\n\u2022 Strong after-care \u2013 Graduates join weekly alumni groups, have a peer mentor, and can access our 24/7 chat line and mobile \u201ccraving-coping\u201d app for a full year.\n\nImpact so far\n-------------\nLast year 75 % of clients who completed a program were still substance-free six months later (national average hovers near 50 %). We keep therapist caseloads small (max 6 clients) and track anonymous outcomes data so we can keep improving.\n\nWhere tech meets recovery\n-------------------------\nBecause you\u2019re in software, you might appreciate that we\u2019re piloting a mobile companion app that delivers just-in-time coping exercises and aggregates usage data (fully anonymized) to personalize care plans. We\u2019re also experimenting with VR mindfulness modules\u2014happy to nerd out on those details if you\u2019re interested!\n\nWays to get involved\n--------------------\n\u2022 Volunteer: run a Saturday skills workshop (resume building, intro to coding, etc.)\n\u2022 Mentor: pair with alumni transitioning into tech roles.\n\u2022 Come visit: I\u2019d be glad to give you a short tour or let you sit in on a non-clinical group session to see the vibe first-hand.\n\nLet me know if any of that piques your interest or if you have questions. Always happy to chat.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Your Name]\nProgram Coordinator, Serenity Path Recovery Center\nphone | website",
