  "email_content": "Dear Dr. Smith,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I\u2019m writing to share an overview of our most recent findings on how passengers perceive and experience public spaces across the airport environment.\n\nKey insights\n\u2022 Security checkpoints remain the single greatest source of stress for travelers. Respondents emphasized the need for clearer communication, friendlier staff interactions, and calming design elements (e.g., softer lighting, acoustic treatments) to reduce anxiety.\n\u2022 A strong preference emerged for more personalized, dignity-preserving screening procedures. Passengers highlighted the importance of being treated with empathy and having their privacy respected at every touchpoint.\n\u2022 Comfort factors\u2014way-finding, seating availability, ambient noise, and natural light\u2014continue to shape overall satisfaction. Spaces that successfully integrate these elements tend to receive the highest ratings.\n\u2022 Safety in less-monitored areas (such as restrooms and remote corridors) is a growing concern. A recent incident brought renewed attention to the need for increased visibility of staff and security features in these locations. We recommend trauma-informed design principles, enhanced surveillance, and clearer signage to foster a stronger sense of safety without causing alarm.\n\nNext steps\n1. Translate these insights into actionable design guidelines for upcoming terminal renovations.\n2. Conduct a short co-creation workshop with frontline security staff to explore empathy-focused training modules.\n3. Develop a pilot program that tests calming design interventions (e.g., greenery, sound masking) at one checkpoint before broader rollout.\n\nI\u2019ve compiled the full dataset and detailed analysis in our shared Notion workspace. Please let me know if you\u2019d like direct access or a walk-through of specific sections.\n\nThank you for your continued collaboration. I\u2019m eager to discuss how we can integrate these findings into your ongoing research agenda.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\nPassenger Experience Research Group",
