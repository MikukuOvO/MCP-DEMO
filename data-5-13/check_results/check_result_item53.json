  "email_content": "Hi Emily,\n\nGreat to hear from you! Thanks for asking about life at Sterling & Locke\u2014I love that our pen-pal exchanges always dive into the small cultural details of everyday life.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick snapshot of a fairly typical day for me:\n\u2022 9:00 AM \u2013 I start by reviewing each client\u2019s investment portfolio and flagging anything that needs immediate attention.\n\u2022 10:30 AM \u2013 Our team huddles to chat about market news (today it was all about the latest sustainability regulations in the EU\u2014fascinating!).\n\u2022 1:00 PM \u2013 Lunch in the caf\u00e9 downstairs. The barista already knows my order: oat-milk flat white and a veggie wrap.\n\u2022 2:00 PM \u2013 I disappear into spreadsheets to prep the week\u2019s financial statements. It\u2019s oddly satisfying when the numbers finally reconcile.\n\u2022 4:00 PM \u2013 Client calls/meetings. Last week I spoke with a new entrepreneur from Kyoto who kept using proverbs to explain cash-flow\u2014so poetic compared to our standard jargon!\n\u2022 6:00 PM \u2013 A quick look at tomorrow\u2019s calendar, then I\u2019m out the door for an evening run along the river.\n\nSomething you might find funny: we once discovered that a formula error in a gigantic spreadsheet stemmed from someone naming a cell \u201ccoffee_break.\u201d The entire team now double-checks caffeine-related cell names before EOD. \ud83d\ude04\n\nOutside of work, I\u2019ve been practicing a recipe for matcha-raspberry loaf\u2014if it ever turns out Instagram-worthy, I\u2019ll send you a photo.\n\nHow about you? What does a normal Tuesday look like in your part of the world? Any new hobbies or cultural quirks you\u2019ve picked up lately?\n\nWarm regards,\nJane\n",
