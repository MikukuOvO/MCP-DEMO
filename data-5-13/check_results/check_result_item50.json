I\u2019d be happy to help with Alex\u2019s surprise.\n\n\u2022 Birthday: Alex\u2019s birthday is on March 1.\n\u2022 Good days to celebrate: He\u2019s usually off duty on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so either of those could work well for a get-together without raising suspicion.\n\u2022 Gift idea: I\u2019ve been thinking a rugged smartwatch designed for first responders would be perfect\u2014something with GPS, heart-rate monitoring, and discreet notifications. It\u2019s practical for his job and shows we appreciate the work he does.\n\nLet me know what other details you need or if there\u2019s anything specific you\u2019d like me to do (invitations, decorations, etc.). I\u2019m excited to make this a great surprise!\n\nThanks,\nJane",
