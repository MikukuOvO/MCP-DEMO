I wanted to share a quick update on the patients we\u2019ve identified this month who would greatly benefit from Helping Hands\u2019 support services:\n\n1. Mrs. Linda Smith (Age 72)\n   \u2022 Situation: Recovering from recent hip-replacement surgery.\n   \u2022 Need: Reliable transportation to and from her physical-therapy sessions at Mercy General Hospital, twice a week (Tuesdays & Fridays at 10:00 a.m.).\n\n2. Mr. George Brown (Age 78)\n   \u2022 Situation: Lives alone and has reported increasing feelings of loneliness over the past few weeks.\n   \u2022 Need: Regular companionship visits or friendly-caller check-ins to help combat social isolation.\n\nIf you have availability in the coming weeks to place volunteers or arrange services for either of these patients, please let me know and I\u2019ll coordinate the necessary introductions and paperwork.\n\nThank you, as always, for the incredible support your team provides to our patients. Feel free to reach out if you need any additional information.\n\nWarm regards,\nJohn Doe\nSocial Worker, Mercy General Hospital\n(555) 123-4567\n",
