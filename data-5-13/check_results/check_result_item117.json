Below is a brief highlight that you are welcome to use. I\u2019m finalising a longer list and can forward additional spotlights shortly, but I wanted to make sure you had at least one strong story to start with while we work on the remainder.\n\n\u2022 Marcus Antonelli (Class of 2020) \u2013 Community advocate and keynote speaker. Marcus recently delivered an inspiring address at our Alumni Leadership Summit on building resilience and giving back. In addition to mentoring current students, he volunteers with several local non-profits and leads service-learning workshops in the city.\n\nI\u2019ll share further highlights\u2014focusing on graduates who exemplify career success, service, and leadership\u2014within the week. In the meantime, please let me know if you need any additional context, photos, or quotes.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn [Last Name]\nAlumni Relations Coordinator\nGreenfield University",
