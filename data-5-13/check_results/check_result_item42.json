  "email_content": "Dear MedTech Innovations Team,\n\nThank you for providing us with the opportunity to use and evaluate your new patient management system. Overall, the intuitive interface has been well-received in our clinic and has already helped streamline day-to-day workflows.\n\nBelow is a concise summary of our experience and a few suggestions that we hope you will find useful:\n\n1. Flexible scheduling & repeat patterns\n   \u2022 The current medication and therapy-session scheduler allows only basic daily/weekly repeats. Many of our patients follow more complex regimens that change over time (e.g., therapy three times a week, different medications on alternating days). Being able to create fully custom repeat rules\u2014or at least offer \"every X days/weeks\" options\u2014would greatly improve efficiency and reduce manual work.\n\n2. Real-time adjustments\n   \u2022 Care plans frequently evolve. A quick way to bulk-edit future appointments or medication doses without breaking historical records would be extremely helpful.\n\n3. Outcomes & analytics dashboard\n   \u2022 Since implementing the system we have measured roughly a 20 % improvement in overall patient-outcome metrics. Having a built-in analytics module (e.g., customizable charts, cohort analysis) would let us track and demonstrate these gains directly from the platform, rather than exporting the data to an external BI tool.\n\n4. Quality-of-life enhancements\n   \u2022 Drag-and-drop calendar re-ordering\n   \u2022 Colour-coding by service type\n   \u2022 Role-based views so clinicians see only what is relevant to them\n\nWe believe that adding the above capabilities will make the platform even more powerful and versatile for multidisciplinary clinics like ours.\n\nThank you again for your hard work and for considering our feedback. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss these ideas in more detail.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Title / Clinic]\n[Phone]",
