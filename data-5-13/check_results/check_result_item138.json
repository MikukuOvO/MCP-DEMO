We are committed to ensuring that all members of our community have equal access to our programs, activities, and facilities. Below is a brief overview of the accommodations and processes we currently have in place.\n\nWhat We Can Provide\n\u2022 Academic accommodations \u2013 e.g., extended exam time, reduced-distraction testing locations, note-taking assistance, captioning/ASL services, alternative-format textbooks, assistive/adaptive software and hardware.\n\u2022 Housing & dining accommodations \u2013 accessible residence-hall rooms, allergy-aware dining plans, service-animal arrangements.\n\u2022 Campus accessibility \u2013 priority seating, accessible classroom furniture, lab/clinical adjustments, accessible parking and transportation.\n\nEligibility & Required Documentation\nTo determine appropriate accommodations, we review recent medical, psychological, or educational documentation that describes how a disability substantially limits one or more major life activities. If you are gathering information on behalf of a student, please note that documentation must be submitted by the student (or guardian if under 18) directly to our Office of Student Accessibility Services (SAS) to protect privacy.\n\nHow to Request Accommodations\n1. Complete the online Accommodation Request Form (grandview.edu/SASRequest) or email SAS@grandview.edu to request a paper copy.\n2. Upload or send supporting documentation.\n3. Schedule an intake meeting with one of our Accessibility Coordinators to discuss individual needs and develop an Accommodation Letter.\n4. Share the approved letter with relevant instructors or campus departments.\n\nTimeline\nWe recommend initiating the process at least three weeks before accommodations are needed. Certain services (e.g., captioning, alternative-format texts) may require additional lead time.\n\nQuestions or Next Steps\nIf you need more detailed information, sample policy language, or wish to discuss a particular student\u2019s circumstances, please let me know. I would be happy to schedule a brief call or provide any materials your office may require.\n\nThank you again for your interest in Grandview University. I look forward to assisting you.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Title]\nOffice of Student Accessibility Services\nGrandview University\nPhone: (555) 123-4567 | Email: SAS@grandview.edu",
