  "email_content": "Dear Brother Michael,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I\u2019m reaching out to see whether the Light of Hope community might be able to help one of our participants, Tom, as he prepares for a series of job interviews over the next couple of weeks.\n\nTom has been working diligently on his interview skills and has several promising opportunities lined up, but he currently lacks professional attire (a suit, dress shirt, and shoes). Having appropriate clothing would make a significant difference in presenting himself confidently to potential employers.\n\nWould the community have access to a clothing closet, a voucher program, or any other resources that could provide professional attire? If so, could we coordinate a time for me to pick up the items (or, if easier, arrange delivery)? Tom\u2019s first interview is scheduled for the week of __________, so anything we can organize before then would be wonderful.\n\nThank you in advance for any assistance you can offer, and please let me know if there is any information or paperwork you need from me. Your ongoing support means a great deal to our clients.\n\nGratefully,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Position / Organization]\n[Contact Information]",
