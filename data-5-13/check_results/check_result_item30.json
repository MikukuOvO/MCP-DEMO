  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nThank you for reaching out and for your concern about Eric.\n\nEric has provided HR with medical documentation explaining his recent absences. We are actively working with him to ensure he has the flexibility and support he needs as he manages this health matter. At the moment, his doctors anticipate intermittent absences while his treatment plan stabilizes, but they expect his attendance to improve over the next few weeks.\n\nIn the meantime, Eric remains engaged and continues to keep his manager updated on deadlines and deliverables. If you encounter any coverage gaps or need assistance reallocating tasks, please let me know and we\u2019ll coordinate with the team to ensure continuity.\n\nBecause this is a personal medical issue, I\u2019m limited in the specific details I can share, but rest assured that Eric is following the appropriate procedures and we have the necessary documentation on file. If you have any further concerns, feel free to reach out to me or HR directly.\n\nThanks again for your understanding and support.\n\nBest regards,\nJane",
