  "email_content": "Dear Mark,\n\nThank you for your follow-up and for the opportunity to clarify how Union Trust Bank handles customer disputes. Below is a concise, up-to-date overview that addresses the three areas you asked about and highlights the latest improvements to our programme.\n\n1. How a customer initiates a dispute\n\u2022 Any branch, our 24-hour Contact Centre (1-800-UTB-HELP), secure Online Banking portal (Complaints \u25b8 New Dispute) or written letter to the Customer Advocacy Department.\n\u2022 We acknowledge every complaint within five (5) business days, provide a unique case reference and assign a dedicated case manager who serves as the single point of contact.\n\n2. Expected processing times & milestones\n\u2022 Standard cases \u2013 investigation and final response within 30 calendar days (reduced from 35 days in July 2024).\n\u2022 Complex cases \u2013 may extend to 60 days; if so, the customer receives a written interim update at Day 30 explaining the delay and a revised timeline.\n\u2022 Card-transaction disputes \u2013 if investigation is likely to exceed 10 business days, we issue provisional credit by Day 10 in accordance with card-scheme rules.\n\u2022 A formal resolution letter is sent at closure summarising findings, any account adjustments and next-step options.\n\n3. Documentation typically requested\n\u2022 Dispute/chargeback form (digital or PDF).\n\u2022 Account statement showing the transaction(s) in question.\n\u2022 Supporting evidence (receipts, invoices, e-mails or chat transcripts with the merchant, screenshots, etc.).\n\u2022 Government-issued photo ID if the customer has not previously verified identity through our digital channel.\n\nRecent enhancements\n\u2022 Q4-2021: Secure upload portal & electronic signature acceptance introduced (now used in 97 % of submissions).\n\u2022 Jan 2024: Mobile self-service tracking tool launched, giving customers real-time status updates and the ability to add evidence from their phone.\n\u2022 July 2024: Target timeframe lowered to 30 days; average resolution time in 2024 was 22.6 days with 94 % of cases closed inside the target.\n\nEscalation avenues\n\u2022 Internal: A customer may request a secondary review by our Dispute Resolution Committee, chaired by a senior vice-president not involved in the original decision.\n\u2022 External: If still dissatisfied, they may contact the Financial Services Ombudsman or (for card disputes) the relevant card-scheme arbitration panel. Full contact details are provided in every resolution letter.\n\nI hope this answers your questions, but please let me know if you need any additional data points, anonymised case studies or would like to schedule a call.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJane Doe\nSenior Manager, Customer Advocacy\nUnion Trust Bank\n\u260e +1 (555) 987-6543\n\u2709 jane.doe@uniontrustbank.com",
