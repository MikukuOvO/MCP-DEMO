  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well!\n\nI wanted to share a brief update on the intervention strategies our team has been refining over the past quarter:\n\n\u2022 Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): We\u2019ve streamlined our CBT framework and introduced new session guides to help clients identify negative thought patterns more quickly.\n\n\u2022 Motivational Interviewing (MI): Counselors are now using a revised MI protocol focused on building intrinsic motivation within the first two sessions, which has already increased early-engagement rates.\n\n\u2022 Group Therapy Sessions: We\u2019ve expanded group offerings to include trauma-focused and resilience-building tracks. Preliminary data show higher peer-support engagement and improved retention.\n\nOverall, these refinements have produced a notable uplift in client outcomes\u2014our latest analytics indicate a significant improvement in symptom reduction and coping-skills adoption.\n\nPlease let me know if you\u2019d like a deeper dive or any supporting data. I\u2019m happy to set up a call or forward the full overview.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
