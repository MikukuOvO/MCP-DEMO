Here\u2019s a quick summary of where we stand:\n\n\u2022 Security System Upgrade: The new facial-recognition software has now been fully deployed on our Heathrow servers. Initial tests show roughly a 15 % improvement in identification accuracy. We\u2019ll continue performance monitoring this week and will roll out the extended pilot once we sign-off on the metrics.\n\n\u2022 Traffic-Flow Data: The full dataset covering last quarter was shared with you last week. We\u2019ve begun integrating it into our efficiency models so we can pinpoint bottlenecks and model mitigation strategies.\n\n\u2022 Upcoming Milestones:  \n  \u2013 Complete first-pass bottleneck analysis \u2192 5 June  \n  \u2013 Circulate outline of the research paper \u2192 12 June  \n  \u2013 Sync meeting to review findings and next steps \u2192 Targeting next Tuesday (please let me know if that works).\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if there\u2019s anything else you need before our next touch point.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
