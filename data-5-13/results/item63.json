I\u2019m writing to share our most recent insights into how passengers perceive public spaces within transport hubs.\\n\\nKey takeaways:\\n\u2022 Elevated stress and anxiety are common during security procedures. Respondents indicated that more empathetic, human-centred design elements\u2014softer lighting, clearer signage, and staff trained in supportive communication\u2014could ease tension.\\n\u2022 Passengers consistently value privacy and dignity. They favour screening processes that feel personalised yet unobtrusive.\\n\u2022 Feedback also highlighted that areas beyond formal checkpoints\u2014such as restrooms and corridors\u2014must feel equally safe and welcoming. Incorporating calming visual cues and maintaining a visible security presence in these locations were common suggestions.\\n\u2022 Overall, travellers link their sense of safety and comfort to seamless way-finding, predictable wait times, and environments that demonstrate care for personal wellbeing.\\n\\nWe are currently synthesising design recommendations and can share a more detailed brief once finalised. In the meantime, please let me know if any aspect warrants deeper exploration.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[Your Name]\"}"
