Here are a few ideas:\\n\\n1. Strategy Alignment Workshop\\n   \u2022 A half-day, facilitator-led session where small cross-functional groups draft quick roadmaps for key 2023 initiatives and then converge on shared priorities. \\n   \u2022 Outcome: everyone leaves with a clear, common picture of where we\u2019re headed.\\n\\n2. Communication & Collaboration Role-Plays\\n   \u2022 Short, scenario-based exercises that let people practice giving/receiving feedback and clarifying assumptions across departments.\\n   \u2022 Outcome: smoother day-to-day interactions and reduced \\\"lost in translation\\\" moments.\\n\\n3. Problem-Solving \u201cHackathon\u201d\\n   \u2022 Teams tackle a real, upcoming business challenge (e.g., entering a new market) and pitch solutions at the end of the day.  \\n   \u2022 Outcome: fresh ideas plus a sense of collective accomplishment.\\n\\n4. Outdoor Team-Bonding Activity (low-stakes adventure)\\n   \u2022 Something like a ropes or geocaching course that emphasizes trust and communication while still being inclusive for all fitness levels.\\n\\n5. Recharge & Reflection Time\\n   \u2022 Scheduled pockets for mindfulness, journaling, or a guided nature walk so people can process insights and avoid burnout.\\n\\nLogistics Thoughts\\n\u2022 Ideal length: 2.5 days (arrive Day 0 evening; wrap midday Day 3).  \\n\u2022 Group size sweet spot: 8\u201310 per breakout to keep conversations lively but manageable.  \\n\u2022 Location requirements: large flex room + several smaller breakout areas, easy outdoor access.\\n\\nLet me know which of these resonate with you, and I can flesh out agendas, materials, and facilitator options. Happy to jump on a quick call this week if useful.\\n\\nLooking forward to collaborating!\\n\\nBest,\\nJohn\"}"
