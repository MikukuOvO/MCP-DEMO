The upcoming exam will assess the material we have covered up through the end of Week 6.  In particular, you should be comfortable with the following areas:\\n\\n\u2022 All concepts discussed in lecture notes 1 \u2013 6 and their accompanying slide decks\\n\u2022 The core definitions, examples, and problem-solving techniques highlighted in Homework Sets 1 \u2013 3\\n\u2022 The short in-class exercises on critical thinking and application of the main theorems\\n\u2022 Key diagrams and derivations that were emphasized during our problem-solving sessions\\n\\nA good way to prepare is to:\\n1. Work through each of the posted homework solutions and make sure you can reproduce the reasoning without looking at the answers.\\n2. Re-read the summary pages at the end of each lecture hand-out; they list the must-know formulas and ideas.\\n3. Try the practice questions in the study guide (posted on the course site) under timed conditions.\\n\\nIf any specific item on that list feels unclear, please let me know and we can go over it in more detail\u2014either via email or during office hours later this week.\\n\\nBest of luck with your preparation, and don\u2019t hesitate to reach out with further questions.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nProf. Doe\"}"
