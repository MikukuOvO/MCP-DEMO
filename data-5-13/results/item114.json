Please let me know your thoughts and any additional considerations.\\n\\n1. Revenue Diversification\\n\u2022 Identify two to three complementary offerings that leverage our existing capabilities.\\n\u2022 Prioritize options with low upfront investment and quick path to profitability.\\n\\n2. Cost Structure Optimization\\n\u2022 Map fixed vs. variable costs and look for items that can shift toward variable to improve flexibility.\\n\u2022 Evaluate automation opportunities in back-office functions to reduce recurring overhead.\\n\\n3. Cash-Flow Discipline\\n\u2022 Maintain a resilient operating-cash buffer to cover near-term obligations.\\n\u2022 Tighten receivables follow-up while exploring supplier terms that better align outflows with inflows.\\n\\n4. Capital Structure & Funding\\n\u2022 Revisit our debt-to-equity targets in light of today\u2019s rate environment.\\n\u2022 Keep a short list of funding partners ready so we can move quickly if expansion capital is warranted.\\n\\n5. Risk Management & Scenario Planning\\n\u2022 Model best-, base-, and downside scenarios for the next several quarters.\\n\u2022 Stress-test liquidity and covenant headroom under each case to ensure we stay within comfortable thresholds.\\n\\n6. Measurement & Accountability\\n\u2022 For each initiative, set clear KPIs and assign ownership so we can track progress in real time.\\n\u2022 Schedule brief monthly checkpoints to course-correct quickly.\\n\\nIf this outline looks directionally sound, I can flesh out the detailed action plan and timeline. Let\u2019s aim to sync up later this week so we can lock in priorities and delegate tasks.\\n\\nLooking forward to your feedback.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[Your Name]\\n\",\"cc\":null,\"bcc\":null,\"sender\":null}"
