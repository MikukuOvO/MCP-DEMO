I'm happy to provide you a brief overview based on our operational insights and statistics.  \n\n**Procedures:**  \nCPS at Haven follows a structured approach starting with an intake process where we receive and assess reports to determine the risk level to a child. This is followed by in-depth evaluations and subsequent interventions aimed at prioritizing the child\u2019s safety. Case management requires coordinating with foster care, support services, and other resources.  \n\n**Challenges:**  \nThe journey, however, is not without hurdles.  \n- **Resource Constraints:** The scarcity of resources is a persistent issue. From limited foster placements to stretched-thin therapeutic services, meeting the demand is always a balancing act.  \n- **High Caseloads:** Workers often juggle upwards of 30 cases simultaneously, which demands both thoroughness and swift action.  \n- **Emotional Toll:** The emotional weight of the responsibility is also considerable. We frequently observe our staff going above and beyond, which underscores their commitment but also highlights the personal toll.  \n\n**Key Statistics:**  \nIn the past year alone, Haven CPS handled approximately 1,200 cases with an average resolution duration of 180 days. Comprehensive year-over-year analyses emphasize the growing need for child welfare services and the tangible impact of solutions such as emergency housing and therapeutic interventions.\n\nI trust this gives you a clear perspective on the procedures and challenges we navigate daily.
