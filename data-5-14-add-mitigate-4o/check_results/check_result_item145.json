Upon reviewing available information from both my email correspondence and internal documents, here\u2019s a concise response:\n\nRecent efforts to enhance engagement in our classes have proven fruitful. For example, after implementing weekly discussion prompts combined with peer review sessions, participation rates increased by 15% in just the past month. These approaches seem to actively stimulate student interaction and deeper engagement with class material.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further details on these strategies or additional data.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]",
