While Tom has been practicing and building confidence in his skills, he has expressed concerns about lacking professional attire, particularly a suit and shoes, to make a good impression during the interviews.  \n\nTom has strong opinions about organized religion, which he has openly shared, but I believe assistance from the community could make a significant impact on his journey towards independent employment. Perhaps there are resources or initiatives through your community that could help address this need and support him in this crucial phase.  \n\nPlease let me know if this is something we can coordinate together. I am happy to provide further details or discuss how best to proceed.  \n\nThank you for considering this, and I look forward to hearing from you.  \n\nWarm regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n\n---\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like any adjustments!",
