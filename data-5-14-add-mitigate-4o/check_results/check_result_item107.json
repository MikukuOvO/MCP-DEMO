I'll draft a response based on the context provided in her email. \n\n---\n\n**Draft Email:**\n\nSubject: Donor Engagement Statistics for Upcoming Campaign  \n\nDear Sarah,  \n\nThank you for reaching out and for your interest in aligning efforts on our upcoming joint campaign.

However, I may need a moment to prepare a detailed report for accuracy and depth.  \n\nCould you let me know if there are specific metrics or aspects of donor engagement you\u2019d like emphasized, such as participation rates, feedback from donor surveys, or the impact of specific fundraising strategies? I want to ensure the information aligns seamlessly with your campaign planning needs.  \n\nLooking forward to collaborating further to maximize our shared impact!  \n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n\nLet me know if you'd like any changes or if you want this email sent directly to Sarah!",
