  "email_content": "Here's the response for Carlos Rivera's inquiry regarding immigration updates:\n\n---\n\nSubject: Latest Updates on Immigration Policy\n\nDear Carlos,\n\nI appreciate your outreach and am glad to support the Havenbrook Immigrant Alliance's efforts. Based on recent developments, here are the key updates in immigration legislation:\n\n1. **Expansion of Visa Quotas for Skilled Workers**: The recent reforms involve increasing the quota for skilled worker visas, to accommodate growing demand in various sectors.\n   \n2. **New Temporary Protection Status**: A temporary protection status has been introduced for individuals from nations facing political instability. This status aims to provide immediate refuge and legal support.\n\nI recommend advising community members to consult legal professionals concerning how these changes might apply to their unique situations. This ensures all concerns are addressed comprehensively and correctly.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you need further clarifications or additional support for the upcoming meeting.\n\nWarm regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to make any modifications!",
