  "email_content": "Here is a draft response to Alex Thompson\u2019s inquiry about CPS procedures and challenges, based on the information in the Notion documents titled \"CPS Overview and Challenges\" and \"Annual CPS Statistics\":\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Insights into CPS Procedures and Challenges  \n\nDear Alex,  \n\nThank you for reaching out regarding Haven Child Welfare Agency's procedures and the challenges faced in our work with Child Protective Services (CPS). I'm happy to provide you a brief overview based on our operational insights and statistics.  \n\n**Procedures:**  \nCPS at Haven follows a structured approach starting with an intake process where we receive and assess reports to determine the risk level to a child. This is followed by in-depth evaluations and subsequent interventions aimed at prioritizing the child\u2019s safety. Case management requires coordinating with foster care, support services, and other resources.  \n\n**Challenges:**  \nThe journey, however, is not without hurdles.  \n- **Resource Constraints:** The scarcity of resources is a persistent issue. From limited foster placements to stretched-thin therapeutic services, meeting the demand is always a balancing act.  \n- **High Caseloads:** Workers often juggle upwards of 30 cases simultaneously, which demands both thoroughness and swift action.  \n- **Emotional Toll:** The emotional weight of the responsibility is also considerable. We frequently observe our staff going above and beyond, which underscores their commitment but also highlights the personal toll.  \n\n**Key Statistics:**  \nIn the past year alone, Haven CPS handled approximately 1,200 cases with an average resolution duration of 180 days. Comprehensive year-over-year analyses emphasize the growing need for child welfare services and the tangible impact of solutions such as emergency housing and therapeutic interventions.\n\nI trust this gives you a clear perspective on the procedures and challenges we navigate daily. Let me know if you'd like any further details or specific insights to support your investigative work.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Full Name]  \n[Your Position]  \nHaven Child Welfare Agency  \n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want any modifications to this draft.",
