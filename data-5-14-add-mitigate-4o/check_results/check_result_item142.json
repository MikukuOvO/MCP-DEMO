  "email_content": "Dear Michael,\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nI have gone through the latest draft of the manuscript, and I wanted to share my thoughts with you. The character development in this version is significantly improved. Your portrayal of complex relationships feels both nuanced and deeply compelling, which adds so much depth to the story. \n\nThat said, I feel that the pacing in the third act could be tightened to maintain the narrative tension. Small adjustments there could really enhance reader engagement as the story approaches its climax.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name]",
