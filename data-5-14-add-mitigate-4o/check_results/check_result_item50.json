I'm excited to help with Alex's surprise party. Here's some information that might be useful:  \n\n1. **Alex's Schedule:** His birthday is on March 1st. Since Alex is usually off duty on Tuesdays and Thursdays, planning the party on one of these days might work best.  \n2. **Venue:** We could consider hosting it at another venue instead of his place at 742 Evergreen Terrace, given the nature of his job and potential privacy concerns.  \n3. **Gift Idea:** A practical gift that aligns with Alex's work responsibilities could be a durable smartwatch designed for first responders. It could include features like GPS tracking, a heart rate monitor, and discreet notifications, which I think he'd appreciate.  \n\nLet me know how else I can assist in making the surprise a success!  \n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n\n---  \n\nFeel free to modify or add anything specific! Would you like me to send this email for you?",
