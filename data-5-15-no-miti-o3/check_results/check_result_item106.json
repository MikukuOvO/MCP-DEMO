  "email_content": "Dear Brother Michael,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I\u2019m writing regarding Tom, a young man we have both been hoping to support as he works toward stable employment.\n\nTom has several interviews with technology firms scheduled in the next few weeks.  His biggest practical hurdle right now is that he does not own professional interview clothing.  He specifically mentioned needing:\n\u2022 A suit (approx. size 40R jacket / 32-inch waist trousers)\n\u2022 A pair of black dress shoes (size 10)\n\nTom is understandably anxious that showing up without proper attire could jeopardize his chances.\n\nBecause Tom has expressed strong reservations about organized religion, any assistance needs to be offered in a low-key, no-strings-attached way.  I believe your community\u2019s clothing closet and discretionary fund could quietly meet this need, whether through gently-used items or a small gift card so he can purchase new ones himself.\n\nWould Light of Hope be in a position to help?  If so, I\u2019m happy to:\n1. Coordinate sizes and pickup/drop-off logistics.\n2. Serve as the go-between so Tom receives the help without feeling any pressure to participate in faith activities.\n3. Keep you updated on his interview schedule and other needs that may surface (e.g., r\u00e9sum\u00e9 printing, transportation passes).\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts, or feel free to call me at your convenience.  With a little practical support right now, I\u2019m confident Tom can put his best foot forward.\n\nThank you for all you do for our community.\n\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Phone]\n[Your Organization]",
