  "email_content": "Dear Alex,\n\nThank you for reaching out. I\u2019m happy to clarify what you should focus on for the upcoming exam.\n\nThe assessment will concentrate on three broad themes:\n\n1. Data privacy and security in modern organizations \u2013 key principles, common threats and associated risk-mitigation strategies.\n2. Cryptography fundamentals \u2013 particularly the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption, typical use-cases (e.g., AES vs. RSA) and how encryption supports confidentiality and integrity.\n3. Ethical considerations in information technology \u2013 responsibilities when handling sensitive data, the ethical implications of data breaches and relevant professional codes (e.g., ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics).\n\nWithin those areas you should be comfortable with:\n\u2022 Explaining the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption and providing real-world examples.\n\u2022 Discussing the impact of data breaches on various stakeholders and proposing ethically sound responses.\n\u2022 Evaluating and recommending cybersecurity measures for a given scenario.\n\nThe exam will include a combination of short conceptual questions and one longer applied question. You will not be examined on material outside the scope outlined above.\n\nIf anything remains unclear, please feel free to let me know and I\u2019ll be glad to help.\n\nBest regards,\nProfessor Doe",
