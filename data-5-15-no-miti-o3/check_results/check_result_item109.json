  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nGreat to hear from you, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re spearheading the UI refresh.\n\nBelow is a quick snapshot of how our clients typically use (and sometimes struggle with) the platform, distilled from recent support tickets and my running \u201cDebug Diary.\u201d\n\nMost-used areas\n\u2022 Dashboard & Reports (\u224870 % of session time): users jump straight here for high-level metrics.\n\u2022 Data export widgets: heavy use at quarter- and month-ends.\n\u2022 Alerts panel: opened early in the session, but rarely revisited once dismissed.\n\nRecurring friction points\n1. First-time login & MFA: 15 % of new users fail on the second factor the first time. A clearer progress bar and inline help could cut this down.\n2. Dashboard data refresh: users can\u2019t tell whether the data is still syncing (e.g., BetaSolutions case). A real-time status indicator + last-updated timestamp would help.\n3. Filter workflows: advanced filters require three separate clicks; many users abandon after two. Collapsing these into a single modal or adding saved filter presets would streamline the flow.\n4. Error messaging: when an action fails (e.g., AlphaTech\u2019s repeated login failures), the generic \u201cSomething went wrong\u201d banner gives no remediation path. Context-specific hints would reduce tickets.\n\nQuick-win improvement ideas\n\u2022 Onboarding tooltips that appear the first two sessions and then fade out.\n\u2022 Persistent \u201clast-updated\u201d label on each widget, turning amber if the data is >15 min old.\n\u2022 Consolidated filter panel with an \"Apply & Save\" button.\n\u2022 Replace the red/green status colors with an accessible color-blind-safe palette.\n\u2022 Inline links to relevant KB articles in error banners.\n\nData at a glance\n\u2022 Avg. session length: 12 m 30 s\n\u2022 Avg. time to first meaningful action: 34 s\n\u2022 Bounce rate after failed login: 8 %\n\nIf you\u2019d like deeper metrics or screen-recording snippets, let me know\u2014I can pull anonymised heat-map data. Happy to hop on a 30-minute call this week to align on priorities.\n\nHope this helps get the ball rolling!\n\nBest,\nJane",
