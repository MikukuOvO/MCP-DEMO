  "email_content": "Dear CodeCrafters Team,\n\nThank you for your continued partnership with Trustworthy Banking Group. As requested, please find below the information you need for the upcoming software upgrade.\n\n1. General Statistics on Customer Satisfaction\n   \u2022 2021 annual survey: 85 % overall customer satisfaction.  Key positives \u2013 friendly staff & efficient service.  Areas for improvement \u2013 shorter wait times and expanded online-banking options.\n   \u2022 Most recent Q4 snapshot: 90 % satisfaction rate, reflecting a 5 % quarter-on-quarter improvement.\n\n2. Branch Performance Metrics (Q4)\n   \u2022 Total customer transactions: 120,000 (\u2191 5 % vs. Q3).\n   \u2022 All key performance indicators are on or above target across the Downtown, Westside, Eastville and Northend branches.\n\n3. Recent Audit Reports Impacting Requirements\n   \u2022 Downtown \u2013 Ledger reconciliation delays (\u2248 $20 k variance).  Corrective action plan in place; staff retrained.\n   \u2022 Westside \u2013 Missing signatures/approvals on several high-value accounts.  Documentation process tightened and staff re-certified.\n   \u2022 Eastville \u2013 Incomplete electronic-transaction audit trails.  Interim software patch deployed; full audit-trail capability a key requirement for the new upgrade.\n   \u2022 Northend \u2013 Gaps in secure storage of confidential documents.  New information-security policies rolled out; additional encryption & access-control measures required in the upgraded system.\n\n4. Current Digital Infrastructure Overview\n   \u2022 Centralised legacy database handling all customer transactions and data storage.\n   \u2022 Performance bottlenecks and limited security features have been noted \u2013 particularly around audit-trail logging and encryption.\n   \u2022 Objectives for the upgrade:  \n        \u2013 Enhanced security (end-to-end encryption, role-based access control).  \n        \u2013 Improved transaction-processing speed and scalability.  \n        \u2013 Full audit-trail capture & reporting.  \n        \u2013 Modern API layer to support expanded online-banking features.\n\nPlease let me know if you require any additional detail or supporting documentation. I\u2019m happy to schedule a call at your convenience to walk through the above or discuss next steps.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn [Last-Name]\nTrustworthy Banking Group\njohn@example.com\n",
