  "email_content": "Hi Emily,\n\nI wanted to share a quick update on how our new curriculum is performing this semester.\n\nHeadline Results\n\u2022 Overall course grades have risen by 12% compared with last term.\n\u2022 Students are demonstrating stronger critical-thinking and practical application skills in assessments.\n\u2022 Engagement during hands-on activities and case-study sessions is noticeably higher.\n\nStudent Feedback Highlights\n\u2022 Most students praised the real-world relevance of the material and the balance between theory and practice.\n\u2022 Hands-on projects and interactive lessons were cited as the biggest contributors to their learning.\n\nOpportunities for Further Improvement\n\u2022 Several learners felt the leap to the advanced statistics/analytics modules was steep; they asked for additional guidance and review sessions.\n\u2022 Requests for more interactive workshops and small-group discussions came up repeatedly.\n\nNext Steps\n1. Add optional review clinics before advanced assessments.\n2. Build two additional workshop days into the next unit.\n3. Create short video refreshers for complex topics to support self-paced study.\n\nI have a detailed breakdown of the analysis (including anonymised grade distributions and full feedback excerpts) ready in Notion. Let me know if you\u2019d like access or a deeper dive.\n\nThanks for your continued support, and please let me know if there are any other metrics you\u2019d like to see.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
