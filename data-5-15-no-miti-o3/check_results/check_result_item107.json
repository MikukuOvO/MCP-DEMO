  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nGreat to hear from you! Below is a concise look at our most recent donor-engagement data as you plan the upcoming joint campaign.\n\nHeadline Metrics\n\u2022 Donor participation rose 15 % in Q4-2021 compared with the previous quarter, with the holiday-season push accounting for the bulk of the lift.\n\u2022 Our targeted email series to lapsed/prior donors converted at 20 %, generating just over one-fifth of all gifts in the quarter.\n\u2022 Multi-year view: engagement has followed a steady upward trajectory for three consecutive years. Average annual growth in both active donors and total dollars \u2248 12-14 %, thanks largely to personalised stewardship and matching-gift drives.\n\u2022 Highest-performing channels this year:  \n  \u2013 1-to-1 personalised emails (open rate 42 %, click-through 18 %)  \n  \u2013 Matching-gift appeals (average gift size +22 % vs. standard asks)  \n  \u2013 Peer-to-peer social challenges (30 % of new-donor acquisitions).\n\nWhat\u2019s Working\n1. Personalised Outreach \u2013 Segmenting by past giving behaviour and sending tailored impact stories.  \n2. Matching Gifts \u2013 Timed around corporate match periods; donors respond to seeing their impact doubled.  \n3. Story-driven Video Updates \u2013 Short clips from programme sites shared on social media boosted shares and first-time gifts.\n\nNext Steps\nIf helpful, I can send the full Q4-2021 report and the three-year trend deck (with charts) or hop on a quick call to walk through the details and discuss how we can integrate these tactics into the joint campaign.\n\nLet me know what works best for you, and I\u2019ll get it on the calendar.\n\nThanks, Sarah\u2014I\u2019m excited to collaborate again!\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\nDevelopment Manager  \nBright Futures Foundation\njohn@brightfutures.org  |  (555) 123-4567",
