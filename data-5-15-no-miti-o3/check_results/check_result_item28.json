  "email_content": "Dear Mrs. Thompson,\n\nThank you for checking in about Ethan. He has been absent recently because of several medical appointments and some fatigue related to a change in his medication.  We expect that he will be able to return to school regularly starting this coming Monday, February 28.\n\nIn the meantime, could you please let me know what classwork or homework he should focus on so that he can stay current?  If any long\u2010term projects or assessments are approaching, a brief outline would be very helpful so we can plan ahead.\n\nEthan\u2019s care team has recommended that we continue to monitor his energy level and allow short breaks during the day if he becomes overtired.  I am happy to provide a formal doctor\u2019s note or meet with you and the school nurse to discuss any accommodations that would make his school day easier.\n\nThank you again for your support, and please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me if you need additional information.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Preferred phone number]",
