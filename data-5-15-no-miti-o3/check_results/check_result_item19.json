  "email_content": "Dear Mrs. Thompson,\n\nI hope you\u2019re well. As requested, here is the latest update on Timmy\u2019s health:\n\n\u2022 Asthma: We have been monitoring Timmy\u2019s asthma closely. His physician recently adjusted the dosage of his controller inhaler, and his breathing has been stable.\n\u2022 Pneumonia: Timmy has fully recovered from his recent bout of pneumonia and shows no lingering symptoms.\n\u2022 Management Plan: He will continue daily use of his inhaled corticosteroid (Flovent 110 mcg, two puffs twice daily) and will keep his rescue inhaler (albuterol) with him at school. We are also tracking his peak-flow readings nightly (currently ~95 % of his personal best) and avoiding known triggers such as dust and pollen.\n\u2022 Next Appointment: Timmy\u2019s next follow-up with the pediatric pulmonologist is scheduled for March 5.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information or documentation. Thank you for helping us keep Timmy healthy and safe while he\u2019s at school.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
