Below is a concise snapshot of the team\u2019s current performance and recent progress on Project Titan:\n\n========================\nKey Achievements\n========================\n\u2022 Development Progress \u2013 80 % of module integrations are complete and we remain on track for the planned Q2 release. Core-functionality testing will kick off early next week.\n\u2022 System Performance \u2013 Uptime now averages 99.95 % (exceeding the 99.9 % target) and recent optimisations have delivered a 15 % boost in processing speed. User-retention metrics are trending +12 % MoM.\n\u2022 Budget \u2013 We have utilised 73 % of our allocated budget to date and still forecast delivery within plan.\n\u2022 Team Expansion \u2013 Two new AI engineers joined last week and are already contributing to the predictive-analytics module.\n\u2022 Milestones Met \u2013 System architecture, initial user testing and the first implementation stage are all complete (per Notion tracker). Upcoming milestones are final user testing and full system optimisation.\n\n========================\nRisks & Mitigations\n========================\n\u2022 Hardware supply-chain delays continue to be the primary risk. We have identified alternate suppliers and begun contract discussions; impact to the critical path is currently assessed as low.\n\u2022 Resource Balancing \u2013 The conflicts we experienced in January have been resolved through adjusted sprint planning, giving key contributors >80 % dedicated focus on Titan.\n\n========================\nNext Two Weeks\n========================\n1. Complete the UI/UX design review (14 Feb).\n2. Hold the internal milestone gate review (18 Feb) to confirm readiness for Phase-Two development.\n3. Begin regression testing on integrated modules while onboarding the new AI features.\n\nOverall, morale is high and the team is confident heading into the next phase. Let me know if you\u2019d like deeper drill-downs on any metric or if a quick call would be useful\u2014happy to arrange.\n\nLooking forward to our Friday check-in.\n\nBest regards,\nJane\nProject Lead \u2013 Project Titan",
