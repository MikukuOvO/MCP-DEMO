  "email_content": "Dear Oakwood Teaching Alliance team,\n\nThank you for reaching out and for your continued collaboration in making sure every student has what they need to succeed during the upcoming exam period.\n\nI have reviewed the updated accommodation list you sent, along with the most recent care information from our health office. Here are a few key points and confirmations:\n\n1. Emily Watson (Grade 10 \u2013 Epilepsy)\n\u2022  Quiet\u2013room testing with reduced lighting.\n\u2022  10-minute discretionary breaks per hour to manage fatigue.\n\u2022  Seating near the door so that our medical team can assist quickly if required.\n\u2022  Emergency seizure protocol sheet and rescue medication (midazolam) will be stored with the invigilator; I will brief staff on its use the day before exams.\n\n2. Students with ADHD/Executive-function plans\n\u2022  25 % extra time remains appropriate for all listed students.\n\u2022  Noise-cancelling headphones have been ordered; expected delivery is this Friday. I will distribute and label them once they arrive.\n\n3. Readers/Scribes\n\u2022  We have secured three trained parent volunteers to act as readers. I will share the final timetable with them on Monday so that you can double-check coverage.\n\n4. Medical Alert Overview\n\u2022  A laminated one-page summary of all medical alerts (allergies, diabetes, asthma, epilepsy) will be placed in each exam room and staff workroom.\n\nNext Steps\n\u2022  I will upload the signed Individual Accommodation Plans (IAPs) to our shared drive by close of business tomorrow.\n\u2022  Could you please confirm whether any additional documentation is needed for the exam board by the 1 March deadline?\n\nIf it would be helpful, I\u2019m happy to join a short call early next week to walk through any student-specific concerns.\n\nThank you again for your partnership. Please let me know if anything in the outline above needs adjusting.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJane Smith, RN\nSchool Nurse",
