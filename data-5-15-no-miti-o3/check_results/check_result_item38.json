  "email_content": "Dear Mr. Green,\n\nThank you for your email and for detailing how the information will be used to refine EdTech Innovations\u2019 new learning modules.  \n\nWe are pleased to help, but we also need to ensure that we remain fully compliant with our district\u2019s student-privacy policies (FERPA, COPPA) and our own internal data-governance rules.\n\nWhat we can provide\n\u2022 Aggregated, de-identified data such as:\n  \u2013 Average test scores by subject and grade level\n  \u2013 Highest/lowest score range and standard deviation\n  \u2013 Participation rates in extracurricular programmes and classroom activities\n\u2022 No individual-level or demographic identifiers will be included.\n\nNext steps\n1. Please confirm that the above\u00ad-listed aggregated metrics will meet your needs.  \n2. I will then forward the most recent Lincoln High School Student Performance Report (May 2025), generated from our internal analytics workspace, and update it with any additional aggregate views you request.  \n3. Once you confirm receipt, we can sign our standard Data-Sharing Addendum (or use yours if one already exists) to document the safeguards that both parties will follow.\n\nIf the proposed scope or format needs adjustment, just let me know what specific breakdowns would be most helpful and we will do our best to accommodate them while still protecting student privacy.\n\nLooking forward to your reply.\n\nBest regards,\nJane Doe\nData & Assessment Coordinator\nLincoln High School\n(555) 123-4567",
