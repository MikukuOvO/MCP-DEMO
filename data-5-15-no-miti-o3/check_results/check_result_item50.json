  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nGreat to hear from you! I\u2019d love to help make Alex\u2019s birthday surprise special.\n\nHere are a few details that should make the planning easier:\n\n\u2022 Birthday & day off \u2013 Alex\u2019s birthday is 1 March, which conveniently falls on one of his regular days off (he\u2019s usually off duty on Tuesdays and Thursdays).  \n\u2022 Venue considerations \u2013 His address is 742 Evergreen Terrace, but because of his job he prefers not to host large groups at home. A small private room at a caf\u00e9 or restaurant might be more comfortable and keep the surprise intact.\n\u2022 Gift idea \u2013 He has mentioned wanting a durable smartwatch that\u2019s built for first-responders (GPS + heart-rate monitor + discreet notifications). Something like the Garmin Tactix line would be right up his alley.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like me to look into possible venues, handle a group gift, or coordinate anything else.\n\nLooking forward to celebrating Alex!\n\nCheers,\nJane",
