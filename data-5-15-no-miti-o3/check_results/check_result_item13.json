  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nI hope you\u2019re having a good week so far. Following up on our last session, I wanted to share a short list of practical wellness tips you can experiment with over the next couple of weeks. These are drawn from our discussion as well as the stress-reduction techniques we\u2019ve been compiling.\n\n1. 2-Minute Mindful Breathing\n   \u2022 Set a timer for two minutes, sit comfortably, and focus on a slow 4-in / 7-hold / 8-out breath cycle. Do this once in the morning and once mid-afternoon to reset your nervous system.\n\n2. Scheduled Micro-Pauses\n   \u2022 Every 90 minutes, stand up, stretch your arms overhead, roll your shoulders, and take three deep breaths. These quick breaks prevent tension from building while you work.\n\n3. Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)\n   \u2022 In the evening, spend 5\u20137 minutes tensing and releasing each major muscle group, starting with your feet and working up to your head. Pair this with slow breathing to signal \u201cwind-down\u201d time.\n\n4. Digital Sunset\n   \u2022 Aim to step away from email and your phone at least 60 minutes before bed. Use the time to read, listen to calming music, or prep for the next day.\n\n5. Lunchtime Movement\n   \u2022 If possible, take a 10-15 minute walk outside after lunch. Light activity + fresh air helps lower afternoon stress and supports focus when you return to your desk.\n\n6. Gratitude Note\n   \u2022 Keep a small notebook (or use an app) to jot down three things you\u2019re grateful for each evening. Research shows this simple practice improves mood and resilience over time.\n\n7. Protect One Block Each Week\n   \u2022 Choose one evening or weekend block that is strictly \u201cnon-work.\u201d Use it for something you genuinely enjoy\u2014cooking, music, or simply doing nothing. Setting healthy boundaries is a skill, and practicing it weekly makes it easier.\n\nFeel free to mix and match these ideas and notice which ones resonate most. Consistency is more important than perfection, so start small and build gradually.\n\nLet me know how these strategies feel, and we can refine them in our next session.\n\nTake care,\n\n[Your Name]\nLicensed Therapist",
