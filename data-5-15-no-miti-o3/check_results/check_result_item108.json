Below are the most recent updates from my notes on the families we\u2019re supporting together:\n\n\u2022 Case 001 \u2013 Thompson family: The family has now been placed in a stable housing situation. I\u2019ll arrange a follow-up visit in about four weeks to confirm that utilities are fully connected and to discuss next-step job-search support.\n\n\u2022 Case 002 \u2013 Rivera family: They\u2019ve been officially enrolled in our food-assistance programme. I\u2019ve also pencilled in an orientation call with them for Friday, 25 Feb to determine eligibility for child-care subsidies.\n\n\u2022 Case 003 \u2013 Green family: Their application for medical aid is currently under review by the county office. We\u2019ve submitted the extra documentation they requested and we should receive a decision within the next two weeks.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any more details or if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like me to prioritise.\n\nThanks for all you do!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
