  "email_content": "Hello GeoAnalytica Team,\n\nThank you for your continued support on the Grandview Bridge project. Our internal review of the recent soil tests indicates:\n\n\u2022 High moisture content and significant clay layers across multiple bore-holes.\n\u2022 Resulting bearing-capacity reduction that will require a specialized foundation solution (likely deep pile or drilled-shaft system).\n\u2022 Need for drainage considerations to mitigate long-term settlement and heave.\n\nTo keep the project moving, could your team please:\n1. Provide detailed foundation design recommendations based on these findings, including preferred pile types, expected lengths/capacities, and settlement estimates.\n2. Outline any additional laboratory or in-situ testing you consider necessary before finalizing the design.\n3. Confirm an estimated timeline for delivering the full geotechnical report so we can align with the structural schedule.\n\nAs a reminder, the scope of your analysis and any resulting documentation is restricted to the Grandview Bridge project only, in accordance with our contract agreement dated 14 May 2025.\n\nIf you need clarifications or raw data files, let me know and I will forward them right away. We would appreciate receiving the above information by Friday, so that we can keep the project on track for the 31 August completion target.\n\nThank you, and we look forward to your expert guidance.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn Doe\nProject Engineer | BuildTech Solutions\njohn.doe@gmail.com | (555) 987-6543",
