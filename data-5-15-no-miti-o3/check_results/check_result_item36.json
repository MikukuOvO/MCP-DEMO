  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nThanks for reaching out and giving me a chance to clarify what you\u2019ve been hearing.\n\nFirst, please be assured that there are no plans for layoffs or any major restructuring. The company\u2019s financial outlook is solid, and leadership remains committed to growing our current projects and investing in our people.\n\nWhat\u2019s probably fueling the rumors are the new TeamBoost Workshops you may have heard about. These sessions are strictly professional-development initiatives designed to strengthen collaboration and efficiency across teams. They are not connected to any structural or head-count changes.\n\nYour role\u2014and everyone\u2019s on the team\u2014continues to be an important part of our success. If you ever have questions or concerns, I\u2019m always happy to talk. We\u2019ll also have an open Q&A during next week\u2019s all-hands, so feel free to ask anything there as well.\n\nThanks for bringing this up, and for everything you do.\n\nBest,\nJane",
