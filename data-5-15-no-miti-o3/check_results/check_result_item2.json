  "email_content": "Dear Dr. Harris,\n\nThank you for getting in touch. Below is a concise evidence-based framework you can apply when working with clients who present with anxiety disorders. Everything comes from the latest CBT literature and the reference material I have consolidated in my Notion workspace.\n\n1. Initial Assessment\n   \u2022 Use brief, validated scales (e.g., GAD-7, BAI, OCI) alongside a functional analysis of triggers, thoughts, emotions, behaviours and physiological cues.\n   \u2022 Rule out medical contributors (thyroid, cardiac, substance-induced anxiety) and co-morbid mood or trauma disorders.\n\n2. Psycho-education\n   \u2022 Explain the fight-or-flight response, the role of safety behaviours and avoidance, and how exposure plus cognitive work restores a sense of control.\n   \u2022 Normalise anxiety as a protective system that has become hypersensitised.\n\n3. Core CBT Interventions\n   a) Cognitive Restructuring\n      \u2013 Identify automatic thoughts, estimate evidence for/against, generate balanced alternatives.\n      \u2013 Use thought records or the \u201cABCDE\u201d worksheet (Activating event, Beliefs, Consequences, Disputation, Effect).\n   b) Exposure Therapy (In-Vivo & Interoceptive)\n      \u2013 Co-create a graded hierarchy; start with moderate items (Subjective Units of Distress \u2248 40\u201350).\n      \u2013 Emphasise inhibitory-learning: vary context, remain until distress decreases \u2248 50 % or until client habituates.\n   c) Coping Skills & Relapse Prevention\n      \u2013 Diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, 5-senses grounding.\n      \u2013 Problem-solving steps: define, brainstorm, weigh pros/cons, plan, evaluate.\n      \u2013 Develop a \u201ccoping card\u201d with early-warning signs & skills to deploy.\n\n4. Adjunctive Techniques\n   \u2022 Mindfulness-based exercises (3-minute breathing space, body scan) to reduce experiential avoidance.\n   \u2022 Behavioural activation when anhedonia or depression co-occurs.\n   \u2022 Lifestyle: sleep hygiene, limit caffeine, regular exercise (150 min/wk at moderate intensity).\n\n5. Recommended Reading & Tools\n   \u2022 Clark & Beck \u2013 The Anxiety and Worry Workbook (2nd ed.)\n   \u2022 Greenberger & Padesky \u2013 Mind Over Mood (2nd ed.)\n   \u2022 Barlow \u2013 Anxiety and Its Disorders (2021)\n   \u2022 My Notion page \u201cCognitive-Behavioral Techniques for Anxiety\u201d \u2013 contains case vignettes, worksheets and step-by-step exposure templates. Let me know if you\u2019d like shared access.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out if you\u2019d like to discuss a specific case or need further resources. I hope this material proves useful to you and your team at GreenLeaf Wellness.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Your Name], PhD, LPC\nClinical Psychologist\n[Phone | Optional]\n",
