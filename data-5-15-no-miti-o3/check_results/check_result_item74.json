Below is a concise update on our joint project.\n\nTraffic-Flow Analysis\n\u2022 The full Q1 dataset has been integrated into our efficiency models. Preliminary results highlight significant bottlenecks at the Terminal 3 and Terminal 5 departure corridors (average peak-hour throughput down ~11%).\n\u2022 Visuals and the raw spreadsheet are in our shared Drive folder. Please share any additional metrics you\u2019d like me to extract.\n\nSecurity System Upgrade\n\u2022 The new facial-recognition module is now live on server SRV-192; initial tests show a 15 % improvement in identification accuracy.\n\u2022 We\u2019ll rotate server credentials during the next scheduled maintenance window. I\u2019ll send the new login details through our secure channel once that\u2019s complete.\n\nNext Steps\n\u2022 Deep-dive analysis on the identified bottlenecks and draft mitigation strategies \u2013 target completion 27 May.\n\u2022 Merge your preliminary observations into the master report and circulate v1.0 for review \u2013 30 May.\n\u2022 Tentative stakeholder review call \u2013 week of 3 June (please confirm your availability).\n\nLet me know if anything needs adjustment or if you\u2019d like to set up a quick sync.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
