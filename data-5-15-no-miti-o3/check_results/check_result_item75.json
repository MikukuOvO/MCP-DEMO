I wanted to provide a quick update on the patients who could use some extra support this month:\n\n\u2022 Mrs. Linda Smith \u2013 She is recovering from hip surgery and needs reliable transportation to and from her physical-therapy sessions (three times per week from Mercy General Hospital to her home in Oakwood).\n\n\u2022 Mr. George Brown \u2013 He has been experiencing increased loneliness after a recent COPD exacerbation and would greatly benefit from regular companionship visits or weekly check-ins.\n\nPlease let me know if Helping Hands can assist with these needs or if you require any additional information about schedules, contact details, or care plans.\n\nThank you, as always, for the wonderful support your team provides to our patients.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\nSocial Worker, Mercy General Hospital",
