  "email_content": "Salut Emily !\n\nI hope spring in Lyon is treating you well and that your balcony herbs are still thriving. It\u2019s been a whirlwind on my side, so I wanted to send a proper update before the month slips away again.\n\nWorkwise, I\u2019ve been immersed in a rather intense intellectual-property dispute for a tech client. Picture weeks of dissecting patent claims, drafting briefs, and prepping witnesses who speak fluent \u2018blockchain\u2019\u2014all while trying to translate that into plain English for judges and juries. It\u2019s fascinating but definitely stretching every last brain-cell. The biggest challenge is keeping track of a mountain of technical documents and turning them into a clear, persuasive story under tight deadlines.\n\nParallel to that, I\u2019m juggling an environmental-compliance matter for another client and mentoring a junior associate who\u2019s preparing her first oral argument. Add a virtual ethics seminar that started at 3 a.m. our time (coffee was my co-counsel), and you get a rough picture of the current circus.\n\nWhat\u2019s been helping: a strict \u201cno-laptop after 9 p.m.\u201d rule (I break it, but less often now), lunchtime walks, and a weekend hike that reminded me Paris actually has trees when you leave the p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique.\n\nEnough about me\u2014how\u2019s your renovation project coming along? Did you ever solve the tricky staircase issue? And have you discovered any new p\u00e2tisseries I should put on my must-try list for my next visit?\n\nLooking forward to hearing all your news.\n\n\u00c0 tr\u00e8s bient\u00f4t,\n[Your Name]",
