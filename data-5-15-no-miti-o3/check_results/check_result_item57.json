I wanted to share a quick update on our community\u2019s current situation and the latest work happening at Path to Sobriety.\n\nCommunity Snapshot\n\u2022 We\u2019ve engaged 45 community members this month, providing guidance, referrals, and initial recovery resources.\n\u2022 Attendance at our weekly peer-support meetings has risen by roughly 20% over last month.\n\u2022 Twelve (12) individuals have taken the important first step of entering formal rehabilitation programs since our last check-in.\n\nPath to Sobriety \u2013 Recent Activities\n\u2022 Ran three substance-abuse awareness & prevention workshops at local churches and the public library.\n\u2022 Kicked off a new outreach partnership with nearby shelters; the first on-site drop-in session was held last Saturday and drew solid interest.\n\u2022 Planning two additional June workshops that will focus on relapse-prevention skills and family support strategies.\n\u2022 Welcomed six new volunteers who have now completed orientation and are ready to mentor.\n\nNeeds & Next Steps\n\u2022 With meeting attendance climbing, we\u2019re looking for additional trained peer mentors to help facilitate small-group sessions.\n\u2022 If your team has any updated trauma-informed care materials or facilitator guides, we would greatly appreciate them.\n\nThanks as always for your support and collaboration, Tom. Please let me know if there\u2019s anything else you\u2019d like to dive into or if you\u2019d like to participate in any of our upcoming events.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Your Name]\nPath to Sobriety",
