  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well! I wanted to give you a concise update on how things are going with the individuals and programs we\u2019re jointly supporting.\n\nMichael\n\u2022 He wrapped up the New Horizons advanced welding course with top marks and is now actively interviewing\u2014two interviews are set for this week.\n\u2022 Financially, he\u2019s doing much better: he put $500 into savings this month, keeps monthly expenses around $700, and brings in roughly $1,200 from his part-time job at the hardware store.\n\u2022 His remaining student-loan balance is $4,500; he\u2019s making steady $150 payments and is on track with the repayment plan.\n\nCommunity Center Snapshot\n\u2022 Volunteer engagement continues to rise\u2014Unity Church members filled every volunteer slot for May events. Thank you!\n\u2022 The center\u2019s finances are solid: $120 k came in last year from donations, grants, and fundraising. Only debt is a small $10 k facility-upgrade loan at 3 % that will be paid off within two years.\n\u2022 With that stability, we\u2019re launching two new initiatives this summer, including a financial-literacy workshop that will directly benefit clients like Michael.\n\nNext Steps / How You Can Help\n1. We\u2019re holding a mock-interview session for Michael next Tuesday at 3 p.m.\u2014let me know if you or one of your volunteers can sit in.\n2. I\u2019ll finalize the summer program calendar by May 28 and will share it for your feedback.\n\nThank you again for your partnership and all the support Unity Church provides. Feel free to reach out if you\u2019d like more information or have additional ideas.\n\nWarmly,\n[Your Name]",
