  "email_content": "Dear Mr. Thompson,\n\nThank you very much for reaching out and for the kind invitation to contribute to Vital Voices. I am honored that my advocacy work resonated with your team, and I\u2019m enthusiastic about the opportunity to help educate and encourage others living with or affected by HIV.\n\nI would be delighted to take part. Writing a guest article that chronicles my personal journey\u2014including the challenges I\u2019ve faced, the lessons I\u2019ve learned, and the importance of early testing, destigmatization, and community support\u2014seems like a natural fit. I have a draft outline based on a recent talk I gave and can adapt it to meet your editorial style and word-count requirements.\n\nIf you prefer an interview format, I\u2019m equally comfortable with a recorded conversation or written Q&A. I\u2019m available most afternoons (EST) next week, and I can provide a short bio and photos upon request.\n\nCould you please share:\n\u2022 Your preferred format (article vs. interview)\n\u2022 Word count or time length guidelines\n\u2022 Deadline for submission or recording\n\u2022 Any specific angles or audience considerations you\u2019d like me to emphasize\n\nOnce I receive those details, I\u2019ll get to work right away so we can publish something impactful together.\n\nThank you again for the invitation and for the important work Vital Voices does. I look forward to collaborating.\n\nWarm regards,\nJane Doe\nHIV Advocate & Speaker\njane.doe@email.com\n(+1) 555-123-4567",
