  "email_content": "Dear Dr. Smith,\n\nI hope you are doing well.\n\nBelow is a concise overview of the most recent findings from our remote learning study (data up to February 2022). All student personal contact details have been removed for privacy; the full technical appendix with raw, de-identified data can be provided on request.\n\nKey highlights\n\u2022 Performance: Aggregate assessment scores remained steady with a slight upward trend (\u2248 2 % increase in average course grades compared with the previous in-person term).\n\u2022 Participation: Live-session attendance averaged 93 %, and 87 % of students submitted all asynchronous assignments on time.\n\u2022 Engagement patterns: Students who used the LMS discussion boards at least twice a week scored an average of 5 percentage points higher than those who did not.\n\u2022 Geographic distribution: Participants came from 12 U.S. states; no statistically significant performance differences were found between urban and non-urban students once broadband speed was controlled for.\n\u2022 Challenges noted: 14 % of students reported intermittent connectivity issues; faculty cited electronic-proctoring fatigue in longer assessments.\n\nWe will continue to track these metrics over the next quarter and will share a fuller report once the next dataset is processed.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like any additional detail or a copy of the full appendix.\n\nBest regards,\nJane",
