Their total hours for this semester are up-to-date in our tracking sheet and continue to grow each week.\n\n\u2022 Roles Undertaken \u2013 They have supported event set-up and tear-down, managed registration tables, packed donation kits, and even mentored newer volunteers.\n\n\u2022 Feedback from Staff \u2013 Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Team members describe the student as punctual, eager to help, and an inspiring presence for others. Several people have referred to them as a true \u201cvaluable asset\u201d to the foundation.\n\n\u2022 Next Steps \u2013 The student is enthusiastic about taking on additional responsibility during the upcoming Community Outreach Fair next month. We\u2019re working on scheduling details now and will confirm with you soon.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information, documentation, or a detailed hour log; I\u2019ll be happy to forward it.\n\nThank you again for the opportunity to collaborate and for all that you do at Helping Hands.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Title]\n[Contact Information]",
