Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)\n   \u2022 Remains our core framework.\n   \u2022 We\u2019ve added new digital worksheets and a real-time journaling feature that helps clients track automatic thoughts between sessions.\n\n2. Motivational Interviewing (MI)\n   \u2022 Introduced a structured four-session protocol to enhance readiness for change.\n   \u2022 Early data show a 25 % increase in goal adherence among participants.\n\n3. Group Therapy Enhancements\n   \u2022 Groups are now organized into smaller, skills-focused cohorts (e.g., stress management, relapse prevention).\n   \u2022 Attendance has increased by 18 % since the change.\n\n4. Resilience & Coping Curriculum\n   \u2022 Integrated weekly mindfulness exercises, brief breathing practices, and physical-activity challenges.\n\nOutcome Snapshot (Q1 \u2192 Q2)\n   \u2022 37 % reduction in self-reported symptom severity.\n   \u2022 42 % improvement in weekly functioning scores.\n   \u2022 91 % client retention through the first eight weeks of care.\n\nNext Steps\n   \u2022 Roll out the CBT digital journal to all clients by July.\n   \u2022 Provide MI protocol training for remaining staff.\n   \u2022 Pilot peer-led support circles in August.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a deeper dive into the metrics or if you see opportunities to align these initiatives with Beacon of Hope\u2019s programs.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
