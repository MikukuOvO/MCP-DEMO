  "email_content": "Hi Alex,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well! I wanted to share a concise update on our patients and current programming.\n\nTom\u2019s Recovery\n\u2022 Tom is continuing to recover from his recent surgery. He still experiences significant post-operative pain that limits mobility, but his overall outlook is positive.\n\u2022 He has been attending every \u201cHealing Together\u201d support-group session and says the conversations have been extremely helpful.\n\u2022 Tom asked me to pass along his gratitude for the mobility aids and educational materials provided by Helping Hands\u2014they\u2019ve made a real difference.\n\nCommunity Wellness Program\n\u2022 Engagement remains high. Attendance at support-group meetings has been strong throughout the month.\n\u2022 Several new patients have begun using the foundation\u2019s resources (transport vouchers, meal kits, counselling hours) and are providing very positive feedback.\n\u2022 Patients repeatedly mention the sense of community and the quality of the resources.\n\nImmediate Needs / Next Steps\n\u2022 Tom may benefit from a lightweight walker once cleared by his physician (likely in 1\u20132 weeks).\n\u2022 A few new participants have requested printed copies of the post-operative home-exercise sheet. Could the foundation print about 20 copies for our next session?\n\u2022 We\u2019re planning an informal peer-led \u201ccoffee & check-in\u201d morning on 2 June. Any support for refreshments would be greatly appreciated.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further details or have other ideas to enhance our patients\u2019 experience.\n\nThank you, as always, for everything you and the Helping Hands Foundation do.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Your Name]",
