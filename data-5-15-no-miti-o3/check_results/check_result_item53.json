  "email_content": "Hi Emily,\n\nIt\u2019s always lovely to hear from you! Thanks for asking about my daily life at Sterling & Locke \u2014 it\u2019s definitely kept me on my toes, but I really enjoy it.\n\nA typical day looks something like this:\n\u2022 9:00 AM \u2013 I ease into the morning by reviewing each client\u2019s portfolio and flagging anything that needs attention.\n\u2022 10:30 AM \u2013 We have a short team huddle where we dissect the latest market trends and share any interesting cases. It\u2019s collaborative and fast-paced \u2014 I learn something new every day.\n\u2022 Lunch around 1:00 PM \u2013 usually with a few teammates so we can swap stories (and occasionally debate whose cuisine reigns supreme!).\n\u2022 2:00 PM \u2013 Deep-dive time: I prep financial statements or fine-tune reports. This is the part I call my \u201cnumber-puzzle\u201d slot because solving accounting discrepancies feels a lot like cracking a code.\n\u2022 4:00 PM \u2013 Client meetings. Talking through their goals and explaining the numbers in plain language is my favourite part \u2014 it makes all the spreadsheets feel real.\n\u2022 6:00 PM \u2013 Wrap-up, note tomorrow\u2019s priorities, and head home.\n\nEven though the schedule is structured, no two days are exactly alike. Cultural-wise, I notice we have a fairly flat hierarchy; juniors can question seniors openly, which I\u2019m told isn\u2019t the norm everywhere. It took me a while to get used to that level of informality, but now I really appreciate how it sparks new ideas.\n\nHow about you? What\u2019s a day in your world like these days? Any new cultural quirks you\u2019ve observed that surprised you?\n\nLooking forward to hearing more!\n\nWarm regards,\nJane",
