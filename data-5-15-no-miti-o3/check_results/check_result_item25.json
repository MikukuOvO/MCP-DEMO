Office Renovation (Starts next Monday \u2013 4 weeks)\n   \u2022 Work will focus on the ground floor, including common work areas and the break room.\n   \u2022 During this period those spaces will be inaccessible; all teams will temporarily relocate to the upper floors.\n   \u2022 Please label any personal equipment before Friday so Facilities can move it safely.\n   \u2022 We will send weekly progress photos and noise-impact notices in the #office-updates Slack channel.\n\n2. AgileBoost Workflow Implementation (Kicks off the week of 21 Feb \u2013 6 weeks total)\n   \u2022 Phase 1 \u2013 Initial Analysis: Mapping current processes and pinpointing improvements.\n   \u2022 Phase 2 \u2013 Team Training: Hands-on workshops (schedule attached in the calendar invite) so everyone is comfortable with the new toolset.\n   \u2022 Phase 3 \u2013 System Setup & Pilot: Configuring AgileBoost and running a small pilot project to iron out any kinks.\n   \u2022 Phase 4 \u2013 Full Roll-out: Company-wide switch with on-call support.\n\nWhat you need to do now\n   \u2022 Renovation: Make sure to clear items from the ground-floor desks by 5 p.m. Friday.\n   \u2022 AgileBoost: Accept the training session invite that best fits your schedule.\n\nThank you for your flexibility as we modernise both our space and our workflow. These improvements are designed to give us a safer, more comfortable environment and a more streamlined way of delivering projects.\n\nQuestions? Feel free to message Facilities about the renovation or the PMO about AgileBoost.\n\nBest,\nJohn\n",
