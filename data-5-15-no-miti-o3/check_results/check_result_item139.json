  "email_content": "Dear Carlos,\n\nThank you for reaching out. Below is a concise summary of the most important federal immigration changes pulled from the Advocate\u2019s Ledger and other official releases as of this week:\n\n1. Skilled-Worker Visa Quotas Expanded\n   \u2022 Starting 1 April 2025, the annual cap for employment-based preference categories has been raised by roughly 25 %.  USCIS will publish a detailed FAQ before the end of the month.\n\n2. New Temporary Protected Status (TPS)\n   \u2022 DHS has granted TPS to nationals of three additional countries experiencing political turmoil.  Initial registration is open for 180 days; protection lasts 18 months with a possible extension.\n   \u2022 TPS applicants may apply simultaneously for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD).\n\n3. Fee-Waiver Rule\n   \u2022 An interim rule now allows low-income applicants to request full fee waivers for adjustment-of-status and naturalization filings.\n\n4. Upcoming Guidance & Engagement\n   \u2022 USCIS will host a stakeholder webinar on 3 June 2025 to walk through the above changes and answer questions.\n\nWhat this means for the Havenbrook Immigrant Alliance\n\u2022 Members with pending skilled-worker petitions should monitor the April Visa Bulletin\u2014their priority dates may become current sooner.\n\u2022 Clients eligible for the new TPS should file promptly to secure protection from removal and work authorization.\n\u2022 Advise anyone concerned about costs to begin gathering financial documentation in order to qualify for the new fee-waiver program.\n\nI have a one-page hand-out summarizing these points and will be happy to share or tailor it for the community meeting.\n\nLet me know if you need more detail or additional talking points.\n\nBest regards,\nJane\nImmigration Policy Advocate",
