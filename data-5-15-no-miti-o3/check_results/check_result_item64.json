  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nWelcome aboard \u2013 I wanted to quickly bring you up to speed on the current status of our active matters so you can hit the ground running.\n\nCase #7643 (State v. Carter Goldstein Client)\n\u2022 Breakthrough evidence: Earlier this week we secured new documentary evidence that directly contradicts the prosecution\u2019s timeline. It strengthens our alternative-theory argument and may open the door to an early Rule 29 motion.\n\u2022 Witness roster: We now have a vetted list of confidential witnesses (former employees, an outside expert, and two individuals with indirect ties). John is coordinating prep sessions; please let me know if you\u2019d like the names/notes \u2013 I\u2019ll circulate them via our secured channel.\n\u2022 Next procedural date: Status conference set for 28 Feb. Our draft agenda and talking points are in the trial-prep folder.\n\nCivil Counter-claim\n\u2022 Discovery closes 4 March. Interrogatory responses from the opposing side are overdue; we\u2019ll move to compel if nothing arrives by Friday.\n\u2022 Damages model has been updated (Notion \u2192 Litigation/7643 \u2192 \u201cDamages v3\u201d).\n\nAdministrative Items\n\u2022 Strategy meeting: Monday 21 Feb @ 10:00 AM in the main conference room / Zoom. We\u2019ll walk through the new evidence and witness prep schedule.\n\u2022 Please review the secure case notebook for a full chronology and document index. Let me know if you don\u2019t yet have access and I\u2019ll grant it immediately.\n\nAgain, welcome to the team. Call or email any time if you have questions before Monday.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\nPartner, Carter Goldstein LLP",
