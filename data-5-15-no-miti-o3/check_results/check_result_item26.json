I wanted to share a brief mid-May update on the Zenith Wellness Initiative.\n\nParticipation & Engagement\n\u2022 Enrollment continues to climb\u201478 % of employees are now actively participating (up from 72 % at the end of March).\n\u2022 The most-used resources are the subsidised gym memberships (60 % uptake) and weekly stress-management workshops (average attendance 45 employees/session).\n\u2022 Early feedback surveys show 87 % of respondents feel the program has had a positive impact on their overall wellbeing.\n\nEarly Outcome Indicators\n\u2022 Aggregate data from the initial health assessments and monthly check-ins show encouraging trends in weight management, cardiovascular health, and reported energy levels. We will share a full metrics dashboard once we have two complete quarters of data so the sample size is statistically meaningful.\n\u2022 Qualitative comments emphasise improved morale, better work\u2013life balance, and a stronger sense of community.\n\nUpcoming Focus Areas (June\u2013July)\n\u2022 Nutrition: rolling out a personalised meal-planning portal and two live cooking demonstrations with our consulting dietician.\n\u2022 Movement: launching a step-challenge that pairs office teams for friendly competition.\n\u2022 Mental Health: adding a mindfulness micro-learning series to complement the existing workshops.\n\nNext Steps\nWe are finalising a Q2 summary report, which will include a cost-benefit snapshot and recommendations for the second half of the year. I will have that ready for your review by 10 June.\n\nPlease let me know if there\u2019s any additional information you\u2019d like in the meantime.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\nWellness Program Coordinator",
