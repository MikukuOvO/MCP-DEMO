After finishing the programme he has now been sober for nine months, attends every community meeting, and recently started mentoring newcomers. Another alumni, \u201cAlice,\u201d not only completed treatment but has also secured a full-time job and moved into her own apartment\u2014huge milestones she once thought were impossible.\n\nMoments like these remind me why the long hours are worth it. How are things on your side of the globe? Any new books, recipes, or cultural quirks you\u2019ve fallen in love with lately?\n\nLooking forward to hearing more about life in your corner of the world.\n\nWarm regards,\nJane",
