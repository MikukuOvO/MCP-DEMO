  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nThank you for reaching out and for your concern about Eric.\n\nEric has provided HR with the necessary medical documentation confirming that he is managing an ongoing health condition. All of his recent absences are covered by this documentation, and we are working closely with him and his physician to ensure he receives the support he needs while he continues his treatment.  \n\nAt this point, Eric anticipates that he may need occasional time away from work on short notice. We have approved his intermittent leave and are encouraging him to give as much advance notice as possible when an absence is necessary.  \n\nIn the meantime, the best way the team can support him is by maintaining flexibility with scheduling and deadlines where feasible and by routing any workload-related questions through me or his immediate supervisor if something time-sensitive arises during one of his absences.  \n\nPlease rest assured that we are monitoring the situation closely and will keep you informed of any changes that could impact project timelines. If you or your team have specific concerns, feel free to let me know.\n\nThanks again for checking in and for your understanding.\n\nBest regards,\nJane\nHR Department\nTechnotronix",
