I am writing to provide an overview of our department\u2019s current compliance status following our recent internal review.\n\n\u2022 Policy Review \u2013 We completed a line-by-line review of the latest international-student regulations issued this quarter. No discrepancies were identified between the new requirements and our existing practices.\n\n\u2022 Faculty & Staff Updates \u2013 All faculty and advisors received a briefing memo last week detailing the changes. Attendance was recorded and everyone has acknowledged receipt and understanding.\n\n\u2022 Documentation \u2013 Required forms, handbooks, and webpages were updated within 48 hours of the policy release. Archived versions have been retained for audit purposes.\n\n\u2022 Ongoing Monitoring \u2013 We established a standing monthly checkpoint to track any additional guidance from your office and to verify continued compliance.\n\nAt this time, we are fully aligned with all current regulations and do not have any outstanding corrective actions.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like further detail or supporting documentation.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Title]",
