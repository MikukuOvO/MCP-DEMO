A few themes keep surfacing:\n\n1. Launch a recurring-giving (\"Community Champions\") program \u2013 predictable monthly revenue and stronger donor loyalty.\n2. Refresh our donor-recognition tiers \u2013 digital badges, quarterly impact spotlights, and an annual appreciation event.\n3. Run a social-media \u201c30-Day Kindness\u201d challenge to engage younger supporters and encourage peer-to-peer fundraising.\n4. Partner with local businesses for in-kind donations that we can convert into auction items or matching-gift pledges.\n5. Pilot alternative giving channels (crowdfunding pages, crypto or contact-less wallet donations) to reach tech-savvy supporters.\n\nI\u2019d love to compare notes with you and map out which of these options best align with Community United\u2019s goals for the year. Are you available for a 30-minute call next week? I\u2019m currently open:\n\u2022 Tue 18 June \u2013 10:00\u201311:30 AM \n\u2022 Wed 19 June \u2013 2:00\u20134:00 PM \n\u2022 Thu 20 June \u2013 9:30\u201311:00 AM \n\nJust let me know which slot works or propose another time and I\u2019ll send a calendar invite.\n\nLooking forward to collaborating and helping our mission reach even more neighbors in need.\n\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Title]\n[Your Phone]",
