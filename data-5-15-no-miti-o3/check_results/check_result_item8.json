  "email_content": "Hello Alex,\n\nThank you for your email and for considering me for the Lead Developer role at InnovateX.\n\nBased on my 8+ years of experience leading cross-functional engineering teams, my current compensation (USD 105,000 base salary plus performance bonus and equity), and current market benchmarks for senior technical leadership roles, I am targeting a total annual cash compensation in the range of USD 135,000 \u2013 145,000. I am also interested in discussing a performance-based bonus structure and equity participation that aligns my contributions with InnovateX\u2019s long-term success.\n\nI believe this range fairly reflects the value I will bring to the team, and I remain flexible to find a package that works well for both of us.\n\nThank you again for the opportunity. I look forward to our next steps.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn Doe\n(555) 123-4567",
