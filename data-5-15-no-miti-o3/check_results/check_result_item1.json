  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nAs promised, here\u2019s a quick summary of our latest conversation on therapy methods: \n\n\u2022 We discussed the integration of the Mindful Acceptance Approach with the Integrated Behavioral Framework.\n\u2022 The combined model blends mindfulness practices\u2014helping clients notice and accept thoughts and feelings\u2014with a structured behavioral program that targets specific actions and habits.\n\u2022 Early evidence suggests the hybrid approach can offer a balanced path, addressing both cognitive-emotional awareness and tangible behavior change.\n\u2022 We see strong potential for improved patient outcomes, especially when clients struggle with either excessive rumination or difficulty translating insight into action.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to dive deeper or need more materials.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
