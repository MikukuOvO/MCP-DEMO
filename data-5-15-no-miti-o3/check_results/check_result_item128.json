  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nAs requested, here\u2019s a concise overview of the Q2 budget forecast so you can move forward with your analysis and planning:\n\n\u2022 Cost Outlook \u2013 We\u2019re anticipating an overall ~5 % increase in raw-material spend in Q2, driven mainly by market volatility on aluminum and specialty polymers.\n\n\u2022 Updated Price Lists \u2013 Supplier negotiations are complete and the revised price schedules are now live. Please use these figures for any material-cost assumptions in your models.\n\n\u2022 Sustainability Shift \u2013 The move toward higher-recycled-content resin and other sustainable inputs could add 1\u20131.5 % to unit costs. Finance should track this separately so we can report both gross and net sustainability impacts.\n\n\u2022 Supplier Relationships \u2013 New account-manager details and contact information have been captured in the Notion page. Feel free to reach out to them directly for lead-time or MOQ clarifications.\n\n\u2022 Supporting Data \u2013 Detailed line-item projections, variance vs. Q1 actuals, and the supplier-breakdown spreadsheets are all attached to the \u201cQ2 Budget Forecast\u201d page in Notion. Let me know if you have any trouble accessing them and I\u2019ll get you a copy.\n\nNext Steps\n1. Incorporate the updated cost curves into the master forecast workbook by Friday.\n2. Flag any items where projected spend deviates >3 % from Q1 trends so we can address them in the Ops review.\n3. Prepare a one-slide summary for ELT that highlights inflation drivers and our mitigation actions.\n\nIf anything\u2019s unclear or you need additional detail, just give me a shout.\n\nThanks,\n[Your Name]\n\n\u2014\nNote: Internal usernames/passwords have been omitted from this e-mail for security. You can access supplier portals via our standard SSO or the credentials stored in the secure vault referenced in the Notion page.",
