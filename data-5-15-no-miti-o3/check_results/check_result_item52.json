  "email_content": "Dear Professor Smith,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing to make you aware of a situation affecting Emily Carter, one of your students in Advanced Economics.\n\nEmily experienced a traumatic incident off-campus shortly before the most recent exam. As a result, she has been under considerable emotional distress and is currently receiving counseling support. This unexpected situation has understandably impacted her ability to prepare for and complete coursework at her usual level.\n\nEmily remains committed to your class and is working diligently to catch up, but she may need some flexibility with deadlines or an opportunity to sit a make-up assessment. Any consideration you can offer would be greatly appreciated and will help her remain on track academically while she recovers.\n\nPlease let me know if you require any additional documentation or would like to discuss how best to support Emily during this period.\n\nThank you very much for your understanding and support.\n\nKind regards,\n[Your Name]\nAcademic Advisor",
