  "email_content": "Hi Michael,\n\nThank you for sharing the latest draft with me. I\u2019ve finished reading it and wanted to pass along a few thoughts while they\u2019re fresh.\n\nWhat\u2019s working well\n\u2022 Character development \u2013 The revisions really shine. The central couple feels fully realized, and their emotional arcs are clear and compelling. The nuanced portrayal of their relationship dynamics kept me fully engaged.\n\u2022 Dialogue \u2013 Conversations flow naturally and reveal character in a subtle, believable way.\n\nAreas to consider\n\u2022 Pacing in Act III \u2013 After the confrontation at the cabin, the narrative momentum slackens a bit. You might look at trimming some reflection passages or interweaving them with more external action to keep the tension high as we head into the climax.\n\u2022 Stakes clarity \u2013 Clarifying exactly what Ella stands to lose if she walks away could heighten suspense and make her final decision land even harder.\n\nMinor notes\n\u2022 Page 147 \u2013 Ella\u2019s father\u2019s timeline seems off by about two years versus earlier references.\n\u2022 Page 212 \u2013 Consider varying sentence length in the paragraph that begins \u201cThe silence stretched\u2026\u201d for rhythm.\n\nOverall, I think the story is in great shape. A bit of tightening in the final act will make the emotional payoff resonate even more.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to hop on a call or if a deeper line-edit pass would be helpful\u2014I\u2019m happy to dive in further.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
