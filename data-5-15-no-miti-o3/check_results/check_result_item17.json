  "email_content": "Hi MedTech Solutions Team,\n\nI hope you are well. We understand that an update to the scheduling and management platform is planned for mid-April. Ahead of that release, we wanted to share a brief overview of the items that are most important to our clinical and administrative teams so we can ensure a smooth transition for both staff and patients.\n\n1. Planned downtime & cut-over schedule\n\u2022\u2003Please confirm the exact maintenance window and expected duration of any service interruptions so we can plan around patient appointments.\n\n2. Data security & HIPAA compliance\n\u2022\u2003Kindly provide details on the new security controls being introduced (encryption standards, access-logging improvements, penetration test results, etc.).\n\u2022\u2003We would also appreciate an updated Business Associate Agreement if the scope of data processing changes in the new release.\n\n3. New feature set and training resources\n\u2022\u2003A concise feature list, release notes, and user-facing change log will help us prepare our documentation.\n\u2022\u2003Do you have quick-start videos or a train-the-trainer deck we can circulate internally? Our preference is to begin short staff sessions ~1 week before go-live.\n\n4. Pre-production testing\n\u2022\u2003If a sandbox or staging tenant is available, we would like access no later than two weeks prior to launch to validate custom appointment types, user roles, and reporting workflows.\n\n5. Post-deployment support\n\u2022\u2003Please share the best channel for critical support during the first 72 hours after the upgrade (direct line, Slack, etc.) and your escalation matrix.\n\n6. Open items from our side\n\u2022\u2003We are prepared to supply anonymized sample data for your QA team if helpful.\n\u2022\u2003Our IT lead (Alex Johnson, alex.johnson@ourclinic.com, +1-555-0167) will be the primary technical contact.\n\nIf any of the above requires a deeper discussion, we would be happy to join a 30-minute call this week.\n\nThank you for your partnership, and we look forward to the enhanced capabilities in the forthcoming release.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\nOperations Manager\nOur Clinic\n",
