Data-driven \u201cearly-alert\u201d analytics\\n   \u2022 We stream grade-book, LMS log-ins, and attendance data into a dashboard that flags students whose performance drops below predetermined thresholds.\\n   \u2022 Faculty receive a weekly list of at-risk students so they can act while the semester is still salvageable.\\n\\n2. Multi-layered support network\\n   \u2022 Discipline-specific tutoring centers (e.g., our CS Help Hub and Quantitative Skills Lab) operate six days a week.\\n   \u2022 Every first- and second-year student is assigned both a professional success coach and a peer mentor trained in motivational interviewing.\\n   \u2022 When a student needs more intensive help, we convene a small \u201ccare team\u201d (advisor, counselor, coach) so the student gets one coherent plan rather than piecemeal advice.\\n\\n3. Structured Academic Recovery plans\\n   \u2022 Students who fall below a 2.0 GPA are placed on probation but, more importantly, they enter a 12-week recovery program that teaches time-management, metacognition, and self-regulation skills.\\n   \u2022 Progress is reviewed every three weeks; if goals are met, the probation status can be lifted at mid-term instead of waiting a full semester.\\n\\n4. Course-embedded metacognitive instruction\\n   \u2022 In core 100-level classes faculty devote 10\u201315 minutes each week to explicit strategies like spaced practice, self-explanation, and error analysis.\\n   \u2022 We have found that normalising these conversations in class makes students far more willing to seek help early.\\n\\n5. An illustrative case\\n   In our Student Performance Case Study (internal doc), a sophomore, \u201cDerek,\u201d entered probation after earning a D+ in Intro Programming, C- in Calculus II, and an F in Computer Architecture.  By combining weekly tutoring, a study-skills workshop, and regular check-ins with his coach, he raised his average quiz scores from 55 % to 78 % and finished the following term with a B- average\u2014clear evidence that early, coordinated intervention works.\\n\\n6. Continuous improvement loop\\n   \u2022 Each semester we compare cohorts with vs. without interventions; GPA lift averages 0.32 points.\\n   \u2022 Findings feed back into faculty development sessions, ensuring the system gets a little better each term.\\n\\nI hope this snapshot is useful.  I\u2019m happy to share sample dashboards, syllabi inserts, or assessment rubrics if you\u2019d like to dive deeper.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[Your Name]\\n[Your Title]\\n[University]\"}"
