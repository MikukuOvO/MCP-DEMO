The dispute is reviewed by our specialist team to determine its validity.\\\\n4. If valid, we contact the merchant for their response.

The customer is informed of the resolution, and if necessary, a refund is processed. The credit card holder in the Glamour Gadgets case was fully refunded the disputed amount.\\\\n\\\\nThis process ensures that all disputes are handled fairly and promptly.
