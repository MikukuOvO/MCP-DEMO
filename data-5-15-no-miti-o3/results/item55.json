I\u2019ve done quite a bit of work on tall-building foundations recently, including a study that fed into our \\\"SkyHigh Tower Structural Analysis\\\" report. Below is a quick overview that should help you move forward; let me know if you\u2019d like to discuss any item in more depth.\\n\\n1. Governing load cases & factors of safety\\n\u2022 Use 1.2D + 1.6L + 0.5W for the extreme gravity case and 0.9D + 1.0W for overturning per ACI 318-19 \u00a79.2.1.\\n\u2022 We targeted an overall FS \u2265 3.0 against bearing failure and \u2265 1.5 against uplift for the mat foundation.\\n\\n2. Soil-structure interaction\\n\u2022 A 3-D finite-element model (we used Plaxis) captured differential settlements from core-to-perimeter load gradients (\u2248 18 % variance in axial load).  An elastic-perfectly-plastic Mohr\u2013Coulomb soil profile with stress-dependent modulus produced the closest match to site plate-load data.\\n\u2022 Allowable net bearing pressure was limited to 480 kPa to keep total settlement < 45 mm and differential < 1/750.\\n\\n3. Foundation concept that worked well\\n\u2022 4.0 m-thick reinforced-concrete mat tied to a 2-level basement.\\n\u2022 1.2 m-diameter CFA piles (30 m embedment) just below the core where overturning moments concentrate; perimeter zones relied solely on mat bearing to minimise stiffness contrast.\\n\\n4. Typical pitfalls we encountered\\n\u2022 Ignoring creep of high-strength concrete in early wind-load combinations \u2013 it can amplify core settlements by up to 12 %.  We included a time-dependent analysis with ACI 209R creep/shrinkage curves.\\n\u2022 Under-estimating construction staging.  Temporary load eccentricities from tower cranes were non-trivial (\u2248 8 % of design moment).\\n\\n5. Resources\\nI\u2019ve published our detailed calculation notes and spreadsheets (including the Plaxis input file) in our internal Notion space:\\nhttps://www.notion.so/SkyHigh-Tower-Structural-Analysis-1f30dc8fa0db817aae5ff694af532e42\\nFeel free to dive in \u2013 the \\\"Foundation Design\\\" section starts ~40 % down the page.\\n\\nLet me know if you need the raw soil lab reports or want to set up a quick call \u2013 always happy to help.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nJane\"}"
