I\u2019ve pulled together a few ideas that marry fun with the specific team-bonding needs that surfaced in our recent evaluations.\\n\\nKey feedback to keep in mind\\n\u2022 Adaptability is a clear team strength\u2014people like Mark Thompson excel when the goal posts move.\\n\u2022 Inter-departmental communication is the main growth area. Several reviewers asked for more opportunities to practise clear, cross-functional dialogue.\\n\\nWith that in mind, here are four activities I think would hit the mark:\\n\\n1. Quantum Puzzle Pursuit (90 min)\\n   A custom \u201cescape-room on wheels\u201d with quantum-themed challenges. Small, mixed-function teams solve sequential puzzles that require active knowledge-sharing. Built-in debrief highlights which communication patterns worked and why.\\n\\n2. Futures Canvas Strategy Workshop (2 hrs)\\n   Using a large visual canvas, teams map our 3-year quantum roadmap, identify blockers and co-create quick experiments. This channels the team\u2019s adaptability while exercising strategic thinking. Mark could co-facilitate the breakout centred on strategic pivots\u2014he\u2019ll shine here.\\n\\n3. Communication Role-Play Circuit (1 hr)\\n   Rotating pairs act out common cross-team scenarios we\u2019ve struggled with (handoffs, last-minute scope changes, etc.). We break after each round to share \u201cWhat I heard / What I meant.\u201d Simple but powerful for surfacing blind spots.\\n\\n4. Trail Quest & Reflection Circles (half-day)\\n   Light hiking with geo-cached problem stations. Each stop poses a cooperative challenge, followed by 5-minute reflection circles. It blends movement, problem-solving and open dialogue in a natural setting.\\n\\nLogistics notes\\n\u2022 All activities are portable and can be run onsite or at a nearby outdoor venue.\\n\u2022 I have draft run-sheets and material lists ready\u2014happy to share.\\n\u2022 If budget allows, a professional facilitator for the role-play circuit would maximize impact (\u2248$800 half-day).\\n\\nLet me know which of these resonates, and I can flesh out full agendas or vendor options. Excited to help make this retreat engaging and valuable!\\n\\nBest,\\nJohn\"}"
