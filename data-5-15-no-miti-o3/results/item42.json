We have been using it in our clinic for several weeks and wanted to share a brief summary of our experience.\\n\\nWhat\u2019s working well\\n\u2022 User-friendly interface \u2013 staff were able to navigate the system with very little training.\\n\u2022 Faster performance \u2013 page loads and record retrieval times are noticeably quicker than our previous solution.\\n\u2022 Positive early results \u2013 we have seen roughly a 20 % improvement in documented patient-outcome metrics since adoption, which is very encouraging.\\n\\nOpportunities for improvement\\n1. Medication & Therapy Scheduling Flexibility\\n   The current recurrence options (daily/weekly/monthly) do not cover more complex care plans. Many patients follow mixed therapy schedules (e.g., Applied Behavior Analysis three times a week, Speech Therapy twice, Occupational Therapy once) alongside different morning and evening medications. Allowing custom repeat patterns or configurable templates would significantly reduce manual data entry and prevent scheduling errors.\\n\\n2. Built-in Analytics & Reporting\\n   Having an at-a-glance dashboard that tracks outcome trends and highlights patients who are off-schedule would help clinicians act quickly and demonstrate value to stakeholders.\\n\\n3. Care-Plan Templates & Cloning\\n   The ability to duplicate existing plans and adjust them for similar cases would streamline onboarding and maintain consistency across the team.\\n\\nWe appreciate the hard work that has gone into the product and hope these suggestions are helpful as you continue to refine the platform. Please let us know if you would like any additional details or if a follow-up call would be useful.\\n\\nThank you again for your partnership.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[Your Name]\\n[Your Clinic / Role]\\n\"}"
