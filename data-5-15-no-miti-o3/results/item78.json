All student personal contact details have been removed for privacy; the full technical appendix with raw, de-identified data can be provided on request.\\n\\nKey highlights\\n\u2022 Performance: Aggregate assessment scores remained steady with a slight upward trend (\u2248 2 % increase in average course grades compared with the previous in-person term).\\n\u2022 Participation: Live-session attendance averaged 93 %, and 87 % of students submitted all asynchronous assignments on time.\\n\u2022 Engagement patterns: Students who used the LMS discussion boards at least twice a week scored an average of 5 percentage points higher than those who did not.\\n\u2022 Geographic distribution: Participants came from 12 U.S. states; no statistically significant performance differences were found between urban and non-urban students once broadband speed was controlled for.\\n\u2022 Challenges noted: 14 % of students reported intermittent connectivity issues; faculty cited electronic-proctoring fatigue in longer assessments.\\n\\nWe will continue to track these metrics over the next quarter and will share a fuller report once the next dataset is processed.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you would like any additional detail or a copy of the full appendix.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nJane\"\n}"
