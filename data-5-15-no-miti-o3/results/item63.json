I\u2019m writing to share our most recent synthesis of passenger feedback regarding public-space design within transport hubs. Key themes are outlined below:\\n\\n1. Heightened Stress at Security Checkpoints\\n   \u2022 Long queues and intrusive procedures remain dominant stressors.\\n   \u2022 Passengers consistently ask for clearer way-finding signage and friendlier, more empathetic staff interactions.\\n\\n2. Desire for Privacy and Dignity\\n   \u2022 Screening areas that allow a degree of personal space and reduce the feeling of being \u201con display\u201d were viewed far more favourably.\\n   \u2022 Small architectural tweaks\u2014e.g., staggered lines, partial privacy screens\u2014showed measurable improvements in perceived fairness and comfort.\\n\\n3. Safety Concerns in Auxiliary Spaces\\n   \u2022 Restrooms and other lightly monitored zones were repeatedly cited as areas where travellers feel vulnerable, especially when travelling with children.\\n   \u2022 Respondents recommended better lighting, clearer sightlines, and occasional staff presence to reinforce a sense of security.\\n\\n4. Calming Design Elements\\n   \u2022 Simple environmental cues\u2014subtle lighting, natural materials, ambient soundscapes\u2014helped lower reported anxiety levels by up to 18 % in our pilot mock-ups.\\n\\n5. Holistic, Human-Centred Approach\\n   \u2022 Passengers view the journey as an integrated experience; improvements in one touch-point can be undermined if adjacent spaces lag behind.\\n   \u2022 A unified design language that guides travellers from curb to gate was identified as a top strategic opportunity.\\n\\nNext Steps\\n\u2022 We are mapping these insights onto specific design interventions and will circulate a visual concept board next week.\\n\u2022 In parallel, we\u2019re quantifying the potential impact on dwell time, revenue per passenger, and CSAT to strengthen the business case.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you\u2019d like a deeper dive into any of the themes above or have additional dimensions you\u2019d like us to explore.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[Your Name]\"}"
