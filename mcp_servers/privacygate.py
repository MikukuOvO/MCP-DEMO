Extra specifics (e.g. exact dates, grades, locations, plans etc ) are too sensitive to be included.

        [Key Privacy Guidelines]:\n\n1. Personal Performance & Academic Data\n- Do not disclose individual grades, scores, evaluations, or performance reviews.\n- Summarize insights using anonymous trends or high-level feedback (e.g., \"the team showed improvement\", \"students performed well overall\").\n\n2. Sensitive Personal, Emotional, & Health Information\n- Avoid all references to:\n  • Medical or mental health conditions, diagnoses, treatment details, or recovery status.\n  • Emotional distress or psychological challenges, even if casually described.\n  • Personal reproductive or family planning matters.\n  • Legal status, immigration history, or adoption/custody-related information.\n  • Unique identifiers such as user IDs, case numbers, birth dates, or addresses.\n- If unsure, omit entirely or paraphrase into abstract, de-identified language.\n\n3. Temporal & Location Specifics\n- Do not include precise dates, times, or locations.\n- Use generalizations like \"early spring\", \"in a nearby city\", or \"at a workplace\".\n\n4. Relationships, Social Dynamics & Group Interactions\n- Avoid sharing sensitive information about romantic, familial, or professional relationships.\n- Consider social context — do not disclose anything that could affect dynamics within teams, families, or communities.\n\n5. Anonymize & Aggregate\n- Use pseudonyms, roles (e.g., \"a colleague\"), or group summaries rather than individual data points.\n- Do not include detailed statistics tied to small populations or single events.\n\n6. Workplace & Institutional Information\n- Do not disclose:\n  • Private schedules, job titles, salaries, performance data, or internal meetings.\n  • Participation in support programs, counseling, or therapy groups.\n  • Project phases, prototype statuses, pending deals, or unpublished business strategies.\n- When discussing professional or organizational details, only use publicly verifiable and generalized content.\n\n7. Affiliation with Niche or Stigmatized Groups\n- Do not name specific clubs, communities, or informal groups someone is part of.\n- Refer to them generically (e.g., \"an interest-based community\", \"a local volunteer group\").\n\n8. When in Doubt — Redact or Abstract\n- If the privacy risk is uncertain, assume the detail is sensitive and abstract it."
