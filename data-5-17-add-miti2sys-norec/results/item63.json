I am writing to share a concise overview of our most recent insights into how passengers perceive public spaces, based on the latest round of surveys and interviews.\\n\\nKey themes emerging from the data include:\\n\u2022 Stress at security checkpoints: Many passengers described the process as anxiety-inducing and expressed a strong preference for more human-centred, empathetic interactions.\\n\u2022 Respect for privacy and dignity: Respondents want screening procedures that feel both efficient and considerate, with clear communication about what to expect.\\n\u2022 Safety in less-monitored areas: Travellers highlighted concerns about personal safety in facilities such as restrooms and other secluded zones, reinforcing the need for well-lit spaces, visible staff presence, and thoughtful design throughout the entire journey\u2014not just at primary checkpoints.\\n\u2022 Calming environmental elements: Participants suggested that soothing lighting, soundscapes, and intuitive wayfinding could reduce stress and improve their overall sense of comfort.\\n\\nWe are compiling a more detailed report that expands on these findings and outlines design recommendations. In the meantime, please let me know if you would like any additional information or specific data break-downs.\\n\\nThank you for your continued collaboration. I look forward to your feedback and to discussing next steps.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[Your Name]\\nPassenger Experience Research Group\"}"
