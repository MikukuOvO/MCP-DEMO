I share your interest in ensuring our courses remain intellectually stimulating and inclusive.\\n\\nBelow are a few practices that have yielded noticeable improvements in participation and overall energy in my recent classes:\\n\\n\u2022 Start with a probing question \u2013 Framing each session around a thought-provoking prompt encourages students to connect prior knowledge to the day\u2019s material from the outset.\\n\\n\u2022 Anchor theory in real-world cases \u2013 Brief examples drawn from current events or industry practice help students see relevance and, in turn, volunteer their own observations more readily.\\n\\n\u2022 Rotate discussion leadership \u2013 Allowing small groups or individual students to guide short segments of the conversation gives them ownership and builds confidence.\\n\\nInformally, these approaches have led to livelier discussions, more consistent attendance, and stronger peer-to-peer support. I am currently gathering more systematic feedback and would be happy to share aggregate observations once the semester wraps up.\\n\\nIf you are exploring similar initiatives, I would welcome the chance to compare notes or collaborate on a small pilot across our sections.\\n\\nThank you again for initiating this exchange, and please let me know how I can support your efforts.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nJane\"}"
