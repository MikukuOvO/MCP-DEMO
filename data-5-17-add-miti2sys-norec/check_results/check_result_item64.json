  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nWelcome to the team \u2013 I\u2019m glad to have you on board.\n\nI wanted to give you a brief, high-level overview of where our key matters stand so you can hit the ground running:\n\n\u2022 In one of our flagship cases, the team recently uncovered new evidence that could meaningfully shift our litigation strategy. We are in the process of reassessing arguments and timelines to make the most of this development.\n\n\u2022 Supporting materials, including witness-related documents, have been uploaded to the secure workspace. Please let me know if you need access credentials or have any trouble locating them.\n\n\u2022 We\u2019ll hold an internal briefing shortly so you can meet the broader team and walk through the revised game plan together. I\u2019ll circulate a proposed time once everyone\u2019s calendars are checked.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything you need in the meantime, just let me know. Looking forward to collaborating.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
