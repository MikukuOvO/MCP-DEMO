  "email_content": "Dear Professor Smith,\n\nI hope you are doing well. I am writing on behalf of Emily Carter, who is enrolled in your Advanced Economics class. Emily recently faced an unforeseen personal circumstance outside of the classroom that has significantly affected her well-being and her ability to prepare for the most recent assessment.\n\nShe is actively addressing the situation and remains committed to keeping up with the coursework. In light of her current challenges, would it be possible to arrange some flexibility\u2014such as a make-up opportunity for the assessment or an extension on upcoming assignments\u2014so Emily can demonstrate her understanding once she is in a better position to do so?\n\nThank you very much for your understanding and support. Please let me know if you require any additional information.\n\nKind regards,\n[Your Name]\n(on behalf of Emily Carter)",
