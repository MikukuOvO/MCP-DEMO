I have reviewed the document and compared it with the information in our care records.\n\nEverything appears to be in alignment, and we will make sure each student receives the appropriate support\u2014whether that involves an adjusted testing environment, additional time, or other agreed-upon measures. For the student with medical considerations, the proposed adjustments are suitable, and we will coordinate with the invigilation team to ensure everything runs smoothly.\n\nPlease let me know if any new information arises or if I can provide further clarification.\n\nKind regards,\nJane\nSchool Nurse",
