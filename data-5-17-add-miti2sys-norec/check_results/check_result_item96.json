  "email_content": "Hello SecureTech Solutions Team,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. As we prepare for the biometric scanner installation for our AeroSecure Access system at the Heathrow International Terminal, please find the key information below:\n\n\u2022 Scanner capabilities: High-resolution fingerprint recognition (\u2265 99.8% accuracy) and facial recognition with low-light support.\n\u2022 Software compatibility: Please ensure full integration with our current security software (version 3.2.1) and register the new scanner IDs in the AeroSecure system.\n\u2022 Operating environment: Devices must function reliably between \u201310 \u00b0C and 50 \u00b0C.\n\u2022 Installation step reminder: After the hardware is in place, the AeroSecure database must be updated with the new scanner IDs. A temporary access credential will be provided to your on-site technician through a secure channel at the start of the job.\n\nCould you please confirm the projected installation window, warranty coverage, and any software licensing needs? If additional information is required, let me know and I\u2019ll arrange it promptly.\n\nThank you for your assistance. I look forward to working with you to complete this project smoothly.\n\nBest regards,\nJane Doe\n",
