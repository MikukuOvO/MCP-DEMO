  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nHere is the information you asked for on our Q1 marketing campaign:\n\nCampaign performance snapshot (first four weeks)\n\u2022 Impressions: ~1.25 million\n\u2022 Click-through rate: ~3.5 %\n\u2022 Conversion rate: ~2.1 %\n\u2022 Revenue generated so far: about $78 K\n\nInitial observations\n\u2022 Results are tracking close to plan, but a few channels have lower engagement than expected. We may want to shift budget toward better-performing outlets.\n\u2022 ROI is solid; however, engagement within certain age brackets (25\u201334 vs. 35\u201344) could use a closer look.\n\u2022 Retention-focused metrics (repeat purchase %, upsell conversions) are not included in this first cut\u2014let me know if you\u2019d like those pulled.\n\nRecommended next steps\n1. Prepare a demographic breakdown for the 25\u201334 and 35\u201344 segments.\n2. Flag any under-performing channels and suggest quick optimizations.\n3. Set up a short touch-base later this week (Thursday afternoon works on my end).\n\nFor a broader view, the \u201cQ1 Marketing Campaign Strategy\u201d page in Notion (see workspace link) outlines our segmentation approach and creative focus for email and social.\n\nLet me know if there\u2019s anything else you need.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
