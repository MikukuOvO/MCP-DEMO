If your network knows anyone who\u2019d like to participate, we\u2019d love to have them.\n\n\u2022 Transparency \u2013 We\u2019re implementing clear, well-documented processes for handling all donations and expenses to keep everything above board and easy to track.\n\nPotential collaboration with Helping Hands\n\u2022 Co-hosting or sponsoring one of the activity stations (for example, a health-check kiosk or a children\u2019s craft corner).\n\u2022 Sharing volunteer opportunities with your mailing list or social channels.\n\u2022 Any logistical advice or lessons learned from events you\u2019ve run would be incredibly helpful.\n\nWould you have time for a quick call next week to discuss how we can partner? Let me know what works best for you.\n\nThank you for all that you and Helping Hands do for the community. Looking forward to working together!\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]",
