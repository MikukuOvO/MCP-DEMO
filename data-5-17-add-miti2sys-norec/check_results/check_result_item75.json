  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I wanted to share a brief update on a few of our patients who could really benefit from Helping Hands\u2019 services:\n\n\u2022 Mrs. Linda Smith \u2013 She is in recovery following a recent surgery and would greatly appreciate help arranging transportation to and from her physical-therapy appointments.\n\n\u2022 Mr. George Brown \u2013 He has been feeling increasingly isolated and would warmly welcome regular companionship visits or friendly check-ins.\n\n\u2022 Mr. Thompson \u2013 He is coping with a significant new health challenge and could use support with transportation and meal deliveries. He appears to meet the criteria for the Silver Care Community Outreach Program as well.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information or documentation. I\u2019m happy to help coordinate next steps so we can get these services in place as soon as possible.\n\nThank you for everything you and the Helping Hands team do.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Role]",
