  "email_content": "Dear Alex,\n\nThank you for reaching out.\n\nThe upcoming exam will focus on three main areas:\n\n\u2022 Fundamental cryptography concepts \u2014 understanding how different encryption approaches compare and when each is appropriate.\n\u2022 Ethical and legal impacts of data breaches on both individuals and organizations.\n\u2022 Evaluating and justifying cybersecurity safeguards in practical scenarios.\n\nBe sure to review the related lecture notes, case studies, and assigned readings. If you can clearly explain these concepts in your own words and apply them to new situations, you will be well prepared.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions.\n\nBest regards,\nProfessor Doe",
