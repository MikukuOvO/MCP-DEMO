  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well today. As we talked about, I wanted to pass along a handful of practical strategies you might find useful for managing day-to-day stress and supporting overall well-being:\n\n1. Mindful breathing \u201cmini-breaks\u201d\n   \u2022 Take a comfortable seat, close or soften your eyes, and follow the natural rhythm of your breath for 2\u20133 minutes.\n   \u2022 If your mind wanders, gently guide your attention back to the sensation of breathing.\n\n2. Progressive muscle relaxation\n   \u2022 Starting with your toes and moving upward, tense each muscle group for a slow count of five, then release.\n   \u2022 Notice the contrast between tension and relaxation to help your body unwind.\n\n3. Movement moments\n   \u2022 Short walks, stretching, or desk-based mobility exercises can refresh both mind and body.\n   \u2022 Even five minutes between tasks can make a meaningful difference.\n\n4. Two-minute micro-meditations\n   \u2022 Pause, focus on a single pleasant sight or sound (e.g., looking out a window, listening to ambient nature sounds), and let yourself be fully present.\n\n5. End-of-day reflection\n   \u2022 Jot down one positive event or accomplishment from the day and one thing you\u2019re grateful for.\n   \u2022 This brief exercise can shift attention away from lingering stress.\n\nFeel free to experiment and pick the techniques that resonate most with you. Consistency\u2014 even in short bursts\u2014often yields the best results.\n\nLet me know how these suggestions work for you or if you\u2019d like to explore additional approaches.\n\nTake care,\n[Your Name]",
