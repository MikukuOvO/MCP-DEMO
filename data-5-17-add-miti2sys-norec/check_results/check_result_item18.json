  "email_content": "Dear Mark,\n\nThank you for your follow-up. Below is an overview of Union Trust Bank\u2019s customer dispute-resolution framework.\n\n1. Initiating a claim\n   \u2022 Customers may file a dispute through our online portal, by phone, or at any branch. A reference number is automatically generated so they can track progress.\n\n2. Preliminary review\n   \u2022 A specialist reviews the claim to confirm we have sufficient information to proceed and will request any supplementary documentation that may be required (for example, a copy of the transaction detail or relevant correspondence).\n\n3. Investigation & merchant contact\n   \u2022 Once a claim is validated, our team contacts the merchant and the card network to gather their response and supporting evidence.\n\n4. Evaluation & decision\n   \u2022 After reviewing all materials, we determine the appropriate outcome in accordance with card-network rules and consumer-protection regulations.\n\n5. Communication & remediation\n   \u2022 We inform the customer of the decision and, when applicable, issue a provisional or final credit to the account.\n\nTypical timelines\n\u2022 Claims are acknowledged within one business day of receipt.\n\u2022 Most investigations are completed within a few weeks; more complex cases that require additional documentation from external parties can take longer. Customers receive periodic status updates throughout.\n\nRequired documentation\n\u2022 In most cases, the initial claim form plus proof of the transaction (e.g., a statement copy) is sufficient. If additional items become necessary, we provide clear instructions and a secure upload portal.\n\nRecent updates\n\u2022 Over the past year we have enhanced the online portal to improve status visibility and introduced additional training for our merchant-response team to shorten investigation times.\n\nI hope this helps clarify our process for your article. I\u2019m happy to discuss further or arrange a call if that would be useful.\n\nBest regards,\nJane Doe",
