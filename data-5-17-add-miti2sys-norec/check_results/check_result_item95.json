  "email_content": "Hello CodeCrafters Team,\n\nThank you for your ongoing support as we prepare for the upcoming software upgrade. Below is an overview of the information you requested. If you need any further clarification, please let me know and I will be happy to arrange a follow-up call.\n\n1. Customer Satisfaction\n\u2022  Our most recent annual survey indicates that the vast majority of customers are satisfied with our services, citing friendly staff and efficient service as key positives.  \n\u2022  Areas we plan to improve in the next release include reducing service wait times and expanding online self-service options.\n\n2. Branch Performance\n\u2022  Performance indicators show a steady, quarter-over-quarter increase in overall transactions and consistent improvements in customer experience across branches.  \n\u2022  Current KPI targets are being met, and no significant performance bottlenecks have been identified.\n\n3. Recent Audit Findings\n\u2022  An internal audit was completed recently.  It highlighted a few procedural and documentation gaps at several branches.  Corrective actions and staff training have been implemented, and no outstanding critical issues remain that would affect software requirements.\n\n4. Digital Infrastructure Overview\n\u2022  Our core banking platform currently runs on a centralized database with legacy middleware.  \n\u2022  Key upgrade objectives are to strengthen security, improve transaction throughput, and position the system for future feature rollouts.  \n\u2022  We would like the new solution to integrate smoothly with existing channels while providing a clear migration path away from legacy components.\n\nPlease confirm that this summary meets your needs or let me know if you would like additional context so we can ensure you have everything necessary for technical scoping.\n\nLooking forward to collaborating with you on the next steps.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\nTrustworthy Banking Group",
