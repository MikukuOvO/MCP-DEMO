I\u2019ve reviewed our recent market research and wanted to share a few headline points that can help shape the next phase of our strategy:\\n\\n\u2022 Technology & Cloud Momentum \u2013 The first quarter showed strong growth in companies tied to cloud infrastructure and related online services. Increasing our exposure here should position the portfolio to benefit from that momentum.\\n\\n\u2022 Diversification Within Tech \u2013 While the large-cap names are leading, the mid-tier providers of specialized SaaS and cybersecurity tools are also expanding margins. A balanced mix can help capture upside while managing concentration risk.\\n\\n\u2022 Liquidity & Risk Management \u2013 Given ongoing rate uncertainty, keeping a modest cash buffer will allow us to act quickly on any near-term volatility without forced sales of core positions.\\n\\n\u2022 Client Alignment \u2013 John Smith is still focused on sustainable, above-benchmark returns with moderate risk. The proposed tilt toward cloud and security names meets that mandate, but I\u2019d like your view on allocation percentages before we finalize.\\n\\nNext Steps\\n1. I\u2019ll build a model illustrating the impact of a 3\u20135 % reallocation toward the cloud/security basket.\\n2. Let\u2019s compare notes on Monday and fine-tune sector weights and hedge parameters.\\n3. We can then schedule a brief call with John to confirm he\u2019s comfortable with the adjustments.\\n\\nLet me know if you see anything I\u2019ve missed or if you\u2019d prefer a different approach. Looking forward to your thoughts.\\n\\nBest,\\nJane\\n\"}"
