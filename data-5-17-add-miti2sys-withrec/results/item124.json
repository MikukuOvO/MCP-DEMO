As promised, here are several classroom practices that have been working well in my creative-writing seminars at Oakwood University. Feel free to borrow, adapt, or remix anything that resonates with your own teaching or personal writing:\\n\\n1. Five-Minute Freewrites\\n   A short, untimed burst of writing at the start of every session helps students silence the internal editor and loosen up their narrative voice. I give a playful prompt (e.g., \u201cwrite from the perspective of a forgotten object\u201d) and emphasize quantity over polish.\\n\\n2. Sensory Detail Scavenger Hunt\\n   Students pair up, step outside for a few minutes, and collect at least three sights, sounds, or textures they might not normally notice. Back in class, they weave those concrete details into a short descriptive paragraph. It\u2019s a simple way to move writing beyond the purely visual.\\n\\n3. The Muse\u2019s Ledger\\n   Each student keeps a pocket notebook (digital or paper) dedicated to fleeting ideas\u2014overheard dialogue, curious images, half-formed questions. We treat it like an \u201cidea bank\u201d they can draw from during longer projects. The key is to jot without judgement and review the ledger once a week to spot emerging patterns.\\n\\n4. \\\"Two Stars and a Question\\\" Peer Feedback\\n   During workshops, every respondent offers two specific strengths they noticed and one genuine, open-ended question about the piece. This structure keeps feedback balanced and encourages revision without deflating early drafts.\\n\\n5. Constraint-Based Exercises\\n   We experiment with six-word stories, lipogram paragraphs (omitting a chosen letter), or retelling a myth in exactly 100 words. The restrictions often spark surprising creativity and demonstrate that limits can be liberating.\\n\\n6. Annotated Close Reading\\n   Before discussing a published story, students mark the margins with what each paragraph accomplishes (sets a mood, plants a question, pivots the tension, etc.). Mapping function to form helps them reverse-engineer craft moves they can repurpose in their own work.\\n\\nIf any of these spark further questions\u2014or if you\u2019d like the full handouts\u2014let me know and I\u2019ll be happy to share. I always enjoy exchanging ideas with fellow literature enthusiasts.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\n\\nJohn \\nProfessor of Creative Writing\\nOakwood University\\n\"}"
