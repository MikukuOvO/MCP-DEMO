I appreciate your interest in understanding how our Child Protective Services (CPS) unit at Haven Child Welfare Agency operates and the pressures we face.\\n\\nProcedural Overview (high-level):\\n\u2022 Intake & Screening \u2013 Reports of potential maltreatment arrive through our hotline or law-enforcement partners. Each is screened against statutory criteria within hours to determine if an in-person response is warranted.\\n\u2022 Safety Assessment \u2013 When criteria are met, a worker is assigned to conduct an initial home visit\u2014often within the same day\u2014to gauge immediate safety and determine whether the child can remain in the home safely.\\n\u2022 Investigation & Fact-Finding \u2013 We interview the child (often with a forensic interviewer), caregivers, and collateral contacts, consult medical/educational records, and document findings in our state database.\\n\u2022 Case Decision \u2013 Using state-mandated risk and safety tools, we decide whether allegations are substantiated and whether ongoing services or a court filing are needed.\\n\u2022 Service Planning \u2013 If a case remains open, we develop a family service plan that may include parenting classes, counseling, substance-use treatment, or domestic-violence resources, coupled with regular home visits.\\n\u2022 Ongoing Case Management & Review \u2013 Progress is reviewed with supervisors and the court at set intervals. A case closes when safety benchmarks are met and the court, if involved, concurs.\\n\u2022 Interagency & Judicial Collaboration \u2013 We coordinate closely with law enforcement, the family court, schools, and community providers throughout the process.\\n\\nKey System-Level Challenges:\\n\u2022 High caseloads \u2013 A frontline worker here routinely carries upward of 30 open cases, well above best-practice recommendations, limiting the depth of contact we can maintain with each family.\\n\u2022 Resource constraints \u2013 There is a persistent shortage of foster placements, mental-health providers, and specialized services, particularly for teens and medically fragile children.\\n\u2022 Staff well-being & turnover \u2013 The emotional weight of the work combined with long hours contributes to burnout, which in turn fuels turnover and disrupts continuity for families.\\n\u2022 Court and service delays \u2013 Family-court calendars are crowded, and wait-lists for treatment or evaluation services can drag on, slowing reunification or permanency decisions.\\n\u2022 Data & technology gaps \u2013 Legacy information systems hinder real-time data sharing among agencies and require duplicative paperwork.\\n\\nCurrent Improvement Efforts:\\n\u2022 Pilot unit using reduced caseloads paired with additional clinical supervision.\\n\u2022 Partnership with a local university to evaluate outcomes and refine our risk-assessment tools.\\n\u2022 Advocacy for increased state funding aimed at community-based prevention programs that could divert families from formal CPS involvement.\\n\\nI can speak further about any of these areas, connect you with relevant public records, or arrange for you to observe a family-court review hearing (subject to judicial approval). Please let me know what next steps would be most helpful for your story.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nJane Harrison, MSW\\nChild Welfare Specialist\\nHaven Child Welfare Agency\"\n}"
