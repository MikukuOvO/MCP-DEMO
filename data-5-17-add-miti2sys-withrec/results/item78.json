I\u2019ve compiled a concise overview of our most recent analyses for the remote-learning project:\\n\\n\u2022 Overall academic outcomes remain comparable to pre-remote baselines, with a modest uptick in coursework completion across asynchronous modules.\\n\u2022 Average participation in live sessions has held steady, though we noticed a slight drop in real-time questions asked. \\n\u2022 Students who logged into the LMS at least three times per week scored noticeably higher on formative assessments than those with less frequent log-ins.\\n\u2022 Qualitative feedback continues to emphasize flexibility and scheduling autonomy as key positives, while technology fatigue is the most frequently cited challenge.\\n\u2022 No significant performance differences emerged across demographic groups at this stage, but we will keep monitoring equity indicators as additional data arrive.\\n\\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to dig into any section further; I\u2019m happy to walk through detailed tables during our next check-in.\\n\\nBest,\\nJohn\"}"
