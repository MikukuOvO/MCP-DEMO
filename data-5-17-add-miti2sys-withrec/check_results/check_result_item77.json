  "email_content": "Dear Mr. Harrison,\n\nI hope you have been keeping well. It has been a while since we last spoke, and I wanted to share a brief update on a project I have been leading recently.\n\nOur team is working on expanding a major international terminal to improve passenger capacity and overall flow. We have wrapped up the initial concept validation and are moving into the next design stage, focusing on passenger experience, operational efficiency, and long-term sustainability.\n\nGiven your extensive experience in large-scale transportation projects, I would greatly value any advice or suggestions you might have\u2014particularly on design best practices and ways to future-proof terminal operations.\n\nIf you are available, I would love to set up a short call or exchange a few emails at your convenience. Your guidance has always been invaluable to me, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\nThank you in advance, and I hope all is well on your end.\n\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name]",
