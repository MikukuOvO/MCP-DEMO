Here are a couple of highlights I\u2019m excited about:\n\n\u2022 We\u2019re finding that roughly three out of every four people who complete our residential program remain on track with their sobriety during the follow-up period we monitor. Watching that percentage inch upward over time keeps the whole team motivated.\n\n\u2022 Earlier this season we piloted a short mindfulness and relapse-prevention workshop. One participant later told us that the techniques helped them navigate a particularly stressful family gathering without turning to substances\u2014a milestone they were proud of and one that reminded all of us why this work matters.\n\nOutside of work, spring is settling in here. I\u2019ve been spending early mornings tending a small plot in the community garden before heading to the Center. The fresh air is a welcome balance to the intensity of the job.\n\nHow are things in Eldoria? Any new books, recipes, or local traditions you\u2019ve been enjoying lately? I\u2019d love to hear all about them.\n\nSending warm thoughts across the miles,\nJane",
