  "email_content": "Hi Alex,\n\nHope you're well. I wanted to share a quick update on our Heathrow efficiency project:\n\n\u2022 Data integration: I've completed the initial processing of the traffic-flow dataset we discussed last week. Early indicators confirm several peak-hour bottlenecks around the central security and baggage reclaim zones.\n\n\u2022 Model refinement: I'm currently feeding the cleaned dataset into our efficiency models to quantify potential time savings from different routing scenarios. Preliminary runs suggest we can reduce average passenger processing time by roughly 10\u201312% if the recommended changes are implemented.\n\n\u2022 Next deliverables: I'll draft the methodology section and the first set of charts for our joint paper over the next few days. Once the results are stable, I'll upload the documents to our shared folder for your review.\n\n\u2022 Upcoming discussion: Could we schedule a call early next week to review the findings and align on the sections you'll be authoring?\n\nLet me know if that time works or if you\u2019d prefer another slot.\n\nBest regards,\nJane",
