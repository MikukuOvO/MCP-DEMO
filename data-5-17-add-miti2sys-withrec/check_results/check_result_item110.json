  "email_content": "Hi Alex,\n\nAs requested, here\u2019s a concise overview of the key technical parameters so you can align the marketing deliverables with our IT environment:\n\n\u2022 Data exchange format: JSON transmitted via HTTPS (RESTful architecture).\n\u2022 Authentication method: OAuth2 using service-level tokens issued through our internal identity provider. Tokens must be refreshed every 8 hours.\n\u2022 Rate limits: 100 requests per minute per client application; burst traffic beyond this will be queued automatically.\n\u2022 Endpoint environments: \n   \u2013 Test: available inside the corporate network for staging and QA.\n   \u2013 Production: hosted in the DMZ, reachable once the VPN tunnel is active.\n\u2022 Core payload fields: product_id, campaign_id, timestamp (UTC), metric_type, metric_value.\n\u2022 Response codes: Standard HTTP status set plus a structured error object (code, message, correlation_id).\n\u2022 Logging & monitoring: All calls are logged centrally and linked to your service token for auditing; please avoid transmitting personal data in payloads.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Confirm that the marketing dashboard can parse the above payload structure.\n2. Let me know if you need sample requests/responses, and I\u2019ll forward mock files.\n3. Once your team signs off, I\u2019ll coordinate a 30-minute test window so we can validate end-to-end.\n\nFeel free to reach out with questions.\n\nBest,\nJane",
