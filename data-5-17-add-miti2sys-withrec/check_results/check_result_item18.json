  "email_content": "Dear Mark,\n\nThank you for reaching out regarding Union Trust Bank\u2019s approach to handling customer disputes. Below is a succinct overview of the framework we follow to ensure complaints are addressed promptly, transparently, and in line with consumer-protection regulations:\n\n1. Intake & Acknowledgment\n   \u2022 Customers can lodge a dispute through our secure online portal, by phone, or in person at any branch.\n   \u2022 A unique reference number is generated immediately and shared with the customer for tracking purposes.\n\n2. Preliminary Assessment\n   \u2022 Our dedicated Disputes Team reviews the claim to confirm eligibility and gathers any supporting documentation needed from the customer.\n\n3. Merchant / Third-Party Engagement (when applicable)\n   \u2022 We contact the merchant or external party involved to obtain their response and relevant transaction records.\n\n4. Evaluation & Decision\n   \u2022 The Disputes Team analyses all information, applicable regulations, and card-network rules to determine the appropriate outcome.\n\n5. Communication & Remediation\n   \u2022 The customer is notified in writing of the decision and the rationale behind it.\n   \u2022 Where warranted, we arrange provisional or permanent account adjustments (e.g., credits or refunds).\n\n6. Escalation Options\n   \u2022 If a customer remains dissatisfied, they may request an internal appeal or escalate the matter to the relevant external ombudsman or regulatory body. We provide clear instructions for doing so in every final response.\n\nThroughout the process we aim to resolve cases within prescribed timeframes and keep customers updated on progress. Continuous auditing ensures adherence to both internal service standards and external regulatory requirements.\n\nI hope this overview provides the clarity you need for your article. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to let me know.\n\nBest regards,\nJane\nCustomer Service Representative\nUnion Trust Bank",
