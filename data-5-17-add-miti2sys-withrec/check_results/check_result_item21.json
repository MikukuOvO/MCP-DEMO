  "email_content": "Hi Alex,\n\nThank you for your work on the recent project. Your analysis shows a solid grasp of the course concepts, and the way you presented your findings\u2014especially your use of visualizations\u2014made your key points clear and persuasive.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to consider as you revise or prepare for future assignments:\n\u2022 Sharpen your hypothesis and research question so readers immediately understand the precise issue you\u2019re exploring.\n\u2022 Provide a brief rationale for your choice of dataset and methods to strengthen the connection between your question and your analytical approach.\n\u2022 Conclude with a short reflection on limitations and possible next steps; this situates your conclusions within a broader context and signals avenues for further investigation.\n\nIf you would like to discuss any of these points in more depth, feel free to stop by during office hours or email me to arrange a meeting.\n\nKeep up the good work, and let me know if you have any questions.\n\nBest,\nProfessor Jane",
