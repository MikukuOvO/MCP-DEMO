  "email_content": "Hi Elaine,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I\u2019ve consolidated the newest survey and interview data from our Skyward Terminal study, and a few clear themes have emerged:\n\n\u2022 Security screening remains the most prominent stress trigger. Participants repeatedly asked for clearer signage, streamlined queue layouts, and procedures that protect individual dignity.\n\n\u2022 Waiting areas that incorporate daylight, natural materials, and acoustic dampening consistently earn the highest comfort ratings and lengthen voluntary dwell time.\n\n\u2022 Restrooms and other low-visibility zones are perceived as the most vulnerable spaces. Respondents highlighted the need for open sightlines, balanced lighting, and discreet assistance options to feel secure.\n\n\u2022 Digital wayfinding and real-time crowding indicators demonstrably reduce anxiety, especially among infrequent travelers.\n\n\u2022 Brief, personable staff interactions (simple greetings and proactive wayfinding offers) significantly improve overall perceptions of safety and welcome.\n\nNext steps\n\u2022 I\u2019d like to translate these insights into measurable design interventions for both the security and restroom modules.\n\u2022 Let\u2019s also fold your ongoing work on environmental stressors into the slide deck for our upcoming stakeholder session.\n\nAre you available to meet early next week to discuss? Just let me know a convenient slot.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn",
