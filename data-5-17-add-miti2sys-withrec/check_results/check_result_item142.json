  "email_content": "Hi Michael,\n\nI\u2019ve finished my read-through of the new draft and wanted to share a few quick thoughts:\n\n\u2022 Character work: The development arc for the central characters feels much richer now. Their motivations come through clearly, and the way you handle the more intricate relationship dynamics is particularly effective.\n\n\u2022 Narrative flow: Overall the structure is solid, but the momentum eases up a bit in the third act. Trimming or streamlining a scene or two there\u2014or tightening some of the transitional beats\u2014could help sustain the tension you\u2019ve built.\n\nI\u2019m happy to discuss any of this in more depth or jot down line-level notes if that would be helpful. Let me know what you think and whether you\u2019d like to set up a call.\n\nGreat work on this draft\u2014I\u2019m excited to see where it goes next.\n\nBest,\nJane",
