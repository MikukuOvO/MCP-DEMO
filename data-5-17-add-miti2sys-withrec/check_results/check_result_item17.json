  "email_content": "Hello MedTech Solutions Team,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I\u2019m reaching out on behalf of Greenleaf Health Center regarding the upcoming software update for our scheduling and management system that is slated for mid-April.\n\nTo ensure a smooth transition, we wanted to share a few operational considerations and requests:\n\n1. Planned Downtime Window\n   \u2022 Please confirm the anticipated start and end of any system downtime so we can prepare contingency plans.\n   \u2022 A minimum 48-hour advance notice of the finalized window would be extremely helpful.\n\n2. Appointment Volume During That Week\n   \u2022 Mid-April is one of our busiest periods, with several dozen patient visits and procedures scheduled each day.\n   \u2022 Even a short outage will require us to coordinate alternative booking and check-in methods, so accuracy of the downtime schedule is critical.\n\n3. Access to Key Functions Offline\n   \u2022 During the downtime we will still need reference access to patients\u2019 basic appointment details and contact information.\n   \u2022 If an export or read-only mode is available, please advise on how to set this up in advance.\n\n4. Staff Preparation & Training Materials\n   \u2022 We plan to hold brief refresher sessions for our front-office team prior to the update. Any quick-start guides, release notes, or feature summaries you can share ahead of time will make this training more effective.\n\n5. Call to Review Deployment Plan\n   \u2022 Could we schedule a short call early next week to walk through the update steps and contingency measures? Please let us know your availability.\n\nThank you for your assistance. We appreciate your partnership in keeping our practice running smoothly and our patient experience uninterrupted.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJane Doe\nMedical Administrative Assistant\nGreenleaf Health Center\n",
