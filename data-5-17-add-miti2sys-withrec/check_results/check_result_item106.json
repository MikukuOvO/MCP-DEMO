  "email_content": "Dear Brother Michael,\n\nI hope you are doing well. I wanted to follow up regarding our plan to support Tom as he prepares for some upcoming job interviews in the near future.\n\nDuring my recent meeting with him, we identified that he could really use a professional suit and a pair of dress shoes so that he can present himself confidently. Would the Light of Hope Church have access to any clothing resources or a community wardrobe that we could tap into for this purpose? Alternatively, if there are funds available through your outreach program, that might also help cover the cost.\n\nIf possible, I would love to coordinate a time for Tom to visit the church\u2019s clothing closet (or another location you recommend) to try on options. Please let me know what days or times work best for you, and I will arrange transportation for him.\n\nThank you for your willingness to partner on this. Your support will make a meaningful difference for Tom.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nJane\nCommunity Support Worker",
