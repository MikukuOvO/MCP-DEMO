  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I\u2019ve been developing a community sports program aimed at engaging local youth in a variety of athletic activities that promote teamwork, discipline, and healthy lifestyles. Given the Active Youth Foundation\u2019s mission and impressive track record, I believe a partnership could greatly amplify the reach and impact of this initiative.\n\nProgram Highlights:\n\u2022 Weekly multi-sport clinics led by certified coaches and volunteers\n\u2022 Emphasis on accessible training, mentorship, and life-skills workshops\n\u2022 Collaboration with local schools and sports clubs for facilities and participant outreach\n\nI\u2019d love to explore how AYF could be involved\u2014whether through coaching support, equipment grants, or co-hosting events\u2014and to hear your ideas on how we can align the program with your current initiatives.\n\nWould you be available sometime next week for a brief call or meeting? Please let me know what works best for you.\n\nLooking forward to the possibility of working together.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\nAthletic Coach\n[phone]\n[email]",
