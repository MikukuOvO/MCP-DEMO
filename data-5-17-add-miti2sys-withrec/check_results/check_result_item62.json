I wanted to share a brief update on the intervention strategies our team has been refining lately:\n\n\u2022 Core approaches: We continue to center our work on cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and structured group sessions. \n\u2022 Recent refinements: We\u2019ve placed a stronger emphasis on building client resilience and reinforcing healthy coping skills, making each modality more responsive to individual needs.\n\u2022 Early outcomes: Across the past few months, we\u2019ve seen a clear upward trend in engagement and overall success rates, indicating that the adjustments are taking hold.\n\nI\u2019d be happy to talk through the details, swap resources, or explore ways our programs might complement one another. Let me know what works best for you.\n\nWarm regards,\nJohn\nAlcohol & Drug Abuse Assistance Coordinator",
