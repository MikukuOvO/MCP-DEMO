Here\u2019s a concise update on where things stand:\n\n\u2022 The v2.3 codebase now contains fixes for the transaction-processing module, along with enhanced data-storage encryption. It\u2019s ready for your review and integration testing.\n\n\u2022 Following our recent sync, you\u2019re set to tackle the client-side implementation of the new encryption algorithm, while I\u2019m finishing the remaining debugging on the shareholder-data encryption issues. I\u2019ll keep you posted on progress.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or spot anything that needs attention.\n\nThanks,\nJane",
