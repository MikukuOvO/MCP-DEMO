  "email_content": "Dear Mrs. Thompson,\n\nThank you for reaching out about Ethan\u2019s recent absences. Ethan has been under my care for an ongoing health matter that occasionally requires rest and outpatient treatment. Over the past several days he needed additional time at home to recover, which explains his absences. He is responding well and, barring any unforeseen changes, we anticipate that he will begin returning to school on a gradual basis early next week. There may still be intermittent days when he needs follow-up appointments or rest.\n\nTo help Ethan stay comfortable and engaged while at school, I recommend the following accommodations:\n\u2022 Provide flexible deadlines and extra time for classwork and assessments.\n\u2022 Allow access to a quiet space if he becomes fatigued during the day.\n\u2022 Ensure he can keep water and light snacks available in class.\n\u2022 Offer modified or alternative activities during physical education and recess when his energy is low.\n\u2022 Arrange note-taking support (scribe, peer notes, or technology) for extended writing tasks if muscle fatigue occurs.\n\nPlease feel free to share these recommendations with Ethan\u2019s teachers and any relevant support staff. I will continue to monitor his progress and will let you know if his needs change.\n\nThank you for your partnership in supporting Ethan.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nDr. Jane Doe, MD\nPediatrician",
