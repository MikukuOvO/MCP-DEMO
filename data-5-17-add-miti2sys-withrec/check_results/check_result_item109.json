Clear entry points\n   \u2022 Users respond best when the main action (e.g., \u201cCreate Project\u201d) is visible above the fold and worded as a verb.\n   \u2022 Secondary actions tucked into menus reduce distraction and shorten task completion time.\n\n2. Dashboard density\n   \u2022 Most users focus on 2\u20133 key metrics; surfacing those first and hiding advanced options behind an \u201cexpand\u201d control keeps the page from feeling overwhelming.\n\n3. Guidance in context\n   \u2022 Light-weight inline tips during the first few sessions help new users but should fade automatically afterward. Overlays that block the workflow tend to increase drop-off.\n\n4. Consistent security cues\n   \u2022 People want reassurance that sensitive operations are protected, but extra modals slow them down. Inline status badges (e.g., a small lock icon with a hover label) strike a better balance.\n\n5. Mobile responsiveness\n   \u2022 Roughly half of traffic now arrives from smaller screens. Components that collapse cleanly into a single-column layout retain the highest engagement.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to dive deeper or see wireframe ideas, let me know\u2014happy to collaborate.\n\nBest,\nJane",
