  "email_content": "Dear Sarah,\n\nI hope you\u0019re doing well! Here\u0019s a concise look at the most recent admissions cycle:\n\n\u0015 Applications continued their steady rise, resulting in our largest applicant pool to date.\n\u0015 Selectivity also increased, with a small percentage of applicants receiving offers of admission.\n\u0015 The incoming class is academically strong; their average standardized test scores place them near the top of national benchmarks.\n\u0015 Students will be joining us from more than 60 countries, making this one of the most internationally diverse cohorts we\u0019ve welcomed.\n\u0015 Interest in interdisciplinary and sustainability-focused programs saw particularly notable growth.\n\nWe\u0019re excited about the energy and perspectives this group will bring to campus later this year. If you\u0019d like additional details or are interested in helping us welcome the newest members of the Pride, just let me know!\n\nWarm regards,\n\nJohn\nAlumni Relations Coordinator\nPrestige University",
