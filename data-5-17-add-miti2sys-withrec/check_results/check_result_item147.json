  "email_content": "Hi Tom,\n\nThank you for reaching out and for the important work HopeBridge Foundation does. Below are a few evidence-based practices that have been effective for us at Westbrook University when supporting students with refugee backgrounds. I hope they\u2019re helpful as you develop or enhance your own programs.\n\n1. Language & Academic Skills Support\n   \u2022 Offer flexible English-as-an-Additional-Language workshops that focus on the academic vocabulary students will encounter in their courses.\n   \u2022 Provide writing-center appointments that are specifically staffed by tutors familiar with multilingual learners.\n\n2. Mentorship & Advising\n   \u2022 Pair each student with a faculty/staff mentor who checks in regularly, helps navigate administrative processes, and serves as a consistent point of contact.\n   \u2022 Encourage near-peer mentoring by matching new arrivals with upper-year students who share a similar cultural or linguistic background.\n\n3. Community Integration\n   \u2022 Host informal social gatherings and discussion circles that allow students to share their experiences and build friendships across cultures.\n   \u2022 Partner with local community organizations so students can engage in volunteer or internship opportunities that foster a sense of belonging beyond campus.\n\n4. Holistic Well-Being\n   \u2022 Coordinate with counseling services to ensure culturally sensitive support is available.\n   \u2022 Schedule workshops on stress management, study strategies, and navigating campus resources.\n\n5. Continuous Feedback & Adaptation\n   \u2022 Conduct short, anonymous check-ins each term to understand emerging needs and adjust programming accordingly.\n   \u2022 Invite student representatives to sit on planning committees so their voices directly shape services.\n\nIf it would be helpful, I\u2019m happy to share sample syllabi for language workshops, mentor orientation materials, or assessment templates we use to track student progress.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to set up a brief call to discuss any of these items in more depth. Looking forward to collaborating.\n\nWarm regards,\nJane\nProfessor & Refugee Student Mentor\nWestbrook University",
