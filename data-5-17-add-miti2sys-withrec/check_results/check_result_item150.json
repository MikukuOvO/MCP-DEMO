  "email_content": "Hi David,\n\nI\u2019ve pulled together a concise set of recommendations that should help us accelerate case throughput and reduce re-work as we move forward with the corporate tax audits:\n\n1. Centralized document repository\n   \u2022 Set up a secure, shared digital folder for each engagement so taxpayers can upload supporting material in one place.\n   \u2022 Automate reminders and version control to cut down on follow-up emails.\n\n2. Risk-based scoping\n   \u2022 Allocate deeper testing to high-exposure items while using streamlined checklists for low-risk areas.\n   \u2022 This keeps our focus on material issues and shortens review cycles.\n\n3. Early identification of incentive opportunities\n   \u2022 Flag activities that may qualify for credits (e.g., R&D) or deductible categories (e.g., research-driven marketing) during initial walkthroughs.\n   \u2022 Guiding companies up-front on proper categorization lowers amendment rates and speeds resolution.\n\n4. Living knowledge base\n   \u2022 Capture recurring issues, clarifications, and best-practice templates in a shared workspace so our combined teams can learn and adapt in real time.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to discuss any of these in detail or have additional ideas. I\u2019m flexible this week to set up a quick call.\n\nBest regards,\nJane Smith\nInternal Revenue Service",
