Volunteer Roster\nI\u2019m finalizing St. Mary\u2019s volunteer list this week. Once you have the Helping Hands participants confirmed, could you share a head-count so we can align our training groups?\n\n2. Training Sessions\nOur team can host the initial orientation in the coming weeks. Would late next month work on your end? If you have preferred days or times, let me know and we\u2019ll accommodate.\n\n3. Materials & Documentation\nYou mentioned the possibility of sharing background resources from your recent programs. Any handouts, guidelines, or lesson-learned notes you can provide will help us build a cohesive training packet.\n\n4. Promotion & Outreach\nWe\u2019re drafting a brief announcement for our respective newsletters and social channels. If you have key talking points or branding requirements, please send them over so we can ensure consistency.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on the timeline above, or if there\u2019s anything else we should cover right away. I\u2019m looking forward to partnering with you and the Helping Hands team to expand counseling services for our community.\n\nThanks again for your collaboration.\n\nWarm regards,\nJane\nSt. Mary\u2019s Church",
