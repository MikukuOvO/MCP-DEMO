I\u2019m writing to share a brief update on our community outreach efforts at New Horizons Recovery Center and to explore opportunities for continued collaboration.\n\nThanks in large part to your past support, our outreach program has achieved meaningful results over the past year, including:\n\u2022 A 40% increase in community engagement with our services.\n\u2022 A 15% improvement in recovery outcomes among participants.\n\nInitiatives such as our \"Steps to Sobriety\" workshop series and the \"Family Support Network\" have been instrumental in these successes. We are eager to build on this momentum by expanding workshop availability, offering transportation stipends for participants, and launching new community education events.\n\nTo do so, we are seeking additional financial support and would welcome the opportunity to discuss specific funding needs and impact goals. I would be happy to share our annual outreach report and answer any questions you may have at your convenience.\n\nThank you for your ongoing partnership and commitment to helping individuals and families affected by substance use disorders.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nJohn\nAlcohol & Drug Abuse Assistance Coordinator\nNew Horizons Recovery Center",
