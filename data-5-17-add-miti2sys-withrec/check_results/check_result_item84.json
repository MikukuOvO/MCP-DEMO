Submit an access request\n   \u2022 Go to the ServiceDesk portal and open a new \"Resource Access\" ticket.\n   \u2022 In the description, mention the project name and note that you need \"Marketing Shared Drive\" access.\n\n2. Await approval\n   \u2022 You\u2019ll receive an automated email once the request is approved (usually within the hour).\n\n3. Connect to the company network\n   \u2022 If you\u2019re working off-site, start the company VPN first.\n\n4. Map the drive\n   \u2022 Windows: Open File Explorer \u2192 right-click \u201cThis PC\u201d \u2192 Map network drive\u2026\n   \u2022 Enter the path: \\\\corp-files\\marketing_shared\n   \u2022 Check \u201cReconnect at sign-in\u201d and \u201cConnect using different credentials,\u201d then click Finish.\n   \u2022 When prompted, sign in with your standard SSO credentials (same as your email login).\n\n5. Confirm permissions\n   \u2022 You should see folders such as \u201cAd Copy,\u201d \u201cCreative,\u201d and \u201cLaunch Assets.\u201d\n   \u2022 If anything is missing or you see an \u201cAccess Denied\u201d message, let me know so I can adjust the ACLs.\n\n6. Sync time\n   \u2022 Permissions sometimes take up to 15 minutes to propagate. Give it a moment before re-trying if you don\u2019t see everything immediately.\n\nProject reminder: Once you\u2019re in the drive you\u2019ll have the latest campaign materials, including the working files for ad copy and social media assets. That should help you stay on track with the upcoming deliverables.\n\nLet me know if you hit any snags or have other questions.\n\nBest,\nJohn",
