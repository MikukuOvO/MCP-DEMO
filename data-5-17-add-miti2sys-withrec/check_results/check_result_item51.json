  "email_content": "Hello Sunny Days families,\n\nThis past week, our budding artists collaborated on a colorful mural that celebrates friendship and creativity. The children brainstormed ideas together, mixed bright paints, and proudly added their individual touches. We can\u2019t wait for you to see it displayed in our classroom entrance!\n\nLooking ahead, we\u2019re excited to roll out a new \u201cBuddy System\u201d designed to strengthen peer connections and encourage children to look out for one another. More details will follow soon, and you\u2019ll begin to hear your child talk about their new \u201cbuddy.\u201d\n\nThank you, as always, for your continued support. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.\n\nWarmly,\nMs. Jane\nSunny Days Childcare Center",
