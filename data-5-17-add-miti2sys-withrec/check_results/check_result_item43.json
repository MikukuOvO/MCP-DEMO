  "email_content": "Hi Lisa,\n\nThank you for joining us to support Ethan. I wanted to share a few insights that will help you get started and feel comfortable in your new role.\n\n\u2022 Structure is key. We follow a predictable pattern through the day: breakfast and gentle wake-up activities in the morning, a focused play/learning block late-morning (puzzles are a big hit), calm reading or music after lunch, then outdoor or therapy-related activities in the afternoon, and relaxing screen-free time before bed. Sticking to this general order, even if exact times need to shift, helps Ethan feel secure.\n\n\u2022 Meals. Ethan prefers warm foods with a fairly soft texture; cold dishes like salads aren\u2019t favourites. Snack staples that usually work are apple slices with peanut butter or crackers with cheese. A quiet, low-noise setting at the table keeps him relaxed.\n\n\u2022 Favourite activities. Anything involving animals (zoo visits or nature documentaries), water play, art projects, and jigsaw puzzles tend to capture his interest and can be used as gentle incentives or calming breaks.\n\n\u2022 Communicating needs. He has been practicing letting us know when he feels overwhelmed and will sometimes ask for a short break or cover his ears. If you notice those signs, offering a quiet space or a brief sensory break usually helps him reset.\n\n\u2022 Sensory considerations. Sudden loud sounds can be challenging, so soft background music and gradual transitions work best.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out anytime with questions or observations\u2014your feedback will be very helpful as we fine-tune routines together.\n\nThanks again for your support!\n\nBest,\nJane",
