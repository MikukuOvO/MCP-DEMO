  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I wanted to share a concise update on how the athletes are progressing:\n\n\u2022 Training load has risen by roughly 15% since our last report, and the group is adapting well.\n\u2022 We\u2019ve logged more than 100 structured training sessions this quarter, with strong attendance and engagement.\n\u2022 Average competition results have improved by about 10%, reflecting the gains we\u2019re seeing in practice.\n\u2022 A few routine niggles are being managed promptly, and everyone remains on track with their individual programs.\n\nWe\u2019ll continue to monitor workload-recovery balance closely and will send a more detailed quarter-end summary next month. Please let me know if you\u2019d like any additional information in the meantime.\n\nThank you for the Foundation\u2019s ongoing support.\n\nBest regards,\nJane",
