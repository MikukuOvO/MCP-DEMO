  "email_content": "Hi Emily,\n\nI wanted to share a brief update on the effectiveness of the new curriculum we've been piloting this semester.\n\n\u2022 Overall student performance improved by roughly 12% compared with the previous term.\n\u2022 Students particularly value the practical, hands-on components and real-world case studies.\n\u2022 Areas for enhancement include providing additional support for advanced modules, more interactive workshops, and dedicated review sessions ahead of major assessments.\n\nThese insights reaffirm that the curriculum is moving in the right direction while highlighting opportunities for further refinement. I look forward to discussing how we can incorporate these findings into our joint initiatives at Bright Futures.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn",
