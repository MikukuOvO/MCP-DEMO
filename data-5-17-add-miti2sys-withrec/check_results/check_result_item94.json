Attendance at the sessions was strong, and participants stayed engaged throughout the presentations and discussions.\n\u2022 Many attendees praised the quality of the educational materials and commented that the content was both informative and accessible.\n\u2022 The inclusion of local historians and storytellers resonated particularly well, helping people connect the material to our region\u2019s heritage.\n\u2022 Several participants expressed an interest in seeing more interactive elements\u2014such as walking tours, hands-on exhibits, or follow-up workshops\u2014to deepen engagement.\n\u2022 There is enthusiasm for holding similar events in the future, with suggestions that we explore additional themes and formats to reach an even broader audience.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like any further details or if there are specific aspects you would like us to track as the initiative continues.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nBest regards,\nJane",
