I have reviewed the document and appreciate the thoughtful measures already outlined.\n\nKey points to confirm:\n\u2022 Quiet testing environments, extended time, and flexible scheduling remain appropriate for the identified students.\n\u2022 For Emily Watson, please ensure she has immediate access to her personal health supplies and that a designated staff member is available to assist her quickly should any health need arise during class or assessments.\n\u2022 Please continue to seat students requiring reduced sensory input away from high-traffic areas.\n\nNext steps:\n\u2022 I will prepare brief accommodation cards for each student and distribute them to homeroom and subject teachers.\n\u2022 Let me know if there are any additional concerns or if you notice changes in student needs so we can adjust promptly.\n\nThank you for your continued partnership in supporting every learner. I am available to discuss further or meet this week if helpful.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJane\nSchool Nurse\nOakwood Elementary",
