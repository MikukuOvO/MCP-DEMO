  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. As promised, here are a few brief wellness tips you might find helpful over the coming days:\n\n1. Mindful Breathing \u2013 Take a minute or two to focus on slow, steady breaths. Inhale through your nose, hold briefly, and exhale through your mouth. Even a few rounds can calm the nervous system.\n\n2. Progressive Muscle Relaxation \u2013 Starting with your feet and moving upward, gently tense each muscle group for about five seconds and then release. This can help relieve accumulated tension.\n\n3. Short Movement Breaks \u2013 A quick walk, some light stretching, or climbing a few stairs can boost energy and lift mood, especially after long periods of sitting.\n\n4. Journaling a Gratitude List \u2013 Noting two or three things you\u2019re grateful for each day can foster a more positive outlook.\n\n5. Digital \u201cPause\u201d \u2013 Choose a short window (for example, during meals) to step away from screens and let your mind reset.\n\n6. Sleep Hygiene Check-In \u2013 Aim for a consistent bedtime routine, dim lights in the evening, and limit caffeine later in the day to improve sleep quality.\n\nFeel free to try whichever ideas resonate with you, and let me know how they work. We can discuss any adjustments or additional strategies when we meet next.\n\nTake care,\nJane\n\n---\nThese suggestions are for general wellness support and are not a substitute for professional medical advice.",
