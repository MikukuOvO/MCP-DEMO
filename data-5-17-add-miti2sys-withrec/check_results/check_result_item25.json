Here are a few quick updates on our workspace and processes:\n\n\u2022 Office renovation: Construction on the ground-floor common areas and break room will begin shortly. We\u2019ll temporarily shift day-to-day work to the upper floors while crews are on site. Clear signage and a brief schedule will be posted as soon as we have the final details.\n\n\u2022 Ergonomic & accessibility improvements: Over the next few weeks you\u2019ll notice upgraded desks, seating, and additional alert equipment being installed around the office. These adjustments are part of our ongoing effort to ensure a comfortable, inclusive environment for everyone. Please reach out to HR if you have any questions or other needs.\n\n\u2022 Workflow evolution: We are rolling out the AgileBoost framework company-wide. The focus is on tighter iteration loops, stronger cross-team collaboration, and greater flexibility in how we plan work. Intro sessions and resource links will go out soon\u2014stay tuned.\n\nThanks for your attention and ongoing support. Let\u2019s keep up the great work!\n\nBest,\nJohn",
