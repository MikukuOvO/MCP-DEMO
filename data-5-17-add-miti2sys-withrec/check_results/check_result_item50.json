  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nGreat to hear from you! I'd love to help with Alex's surprise.\n\nTiming: Alex's birthday falls in early March. From what I know, he usually has his days off on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so planning something on one of those mid-week evenings should work well and reduce the chance that he's on duty.\n\nLocation: We could reserve a casual spot near the station or someone\u2019s place\u2014whatever you think is easiest for the team. Let me know your thoughts.\n\nGift idea: I was thinking of pooling together for a durable smartwatch that\u2019s designed for first responders\u2014something with GPS, health tracking, and discreet notifications. Practical and meaningful for him.\n\nNext steps: Happy to coordinate the guest list, decorations, or anything else you need. Let me know how you\u2019d like to proceed and I\u2019ll jump in.\n\nThanks for pulling this together!\n\nBest,\nJane",
