  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nThanks for reaching out\u2014happy to share a snapshot of our recent donor engagement metrics to help with planning the upcoming joint campaign.\n\nOverall trends (past few years)\n\u2022 Engagement has grown steadily, averaging a low-double-digit percentage increase year-over-year.\n\u2022 Personalized outreach and matching-gift promotions continue to produce the highest response rates.\n\nRecent quarter snapshot\n\u2022 We saw roughly a mid-teens percentage increase in donor participation compared with the same period the previous year.\n\u2022 Holiday-themed appeals were particularly effective, and an email series to lapsed supporters converted about one-fifth of recipients.\n\nKey takeaways for our collaboration\n\u2022 Combining personalized messaging with a matching-gift element could amplify responses.\n\u2022 Timing a multi-channel push around a compelling moment (e.g., back-to-school) tends to create urgency.\n\u2022 Segmenting lapsed supporters for a dedicated email track remains a high-return tactic.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like the full detailed report or any additional metrics\u2014happy to provide average gift size, retention rates, or other specifics. I\u2019m also available for a quick call to discuss how we can align these insights with Compassion in Action\u2019s audience.\n\nLooking forward to working together!\n\nBest,\nJohn\nBright Futures Foundation",
