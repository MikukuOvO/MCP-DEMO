  "email_content": "Dear Mr. Thompson,\n\nThank you for contacting me regarding Grandview University\u2019s compliance with federal disability-accommodation requirements. Below is an overview of our current procedures:\n\n\u2022 Requests are centrally processed by the Office of Student Accessibility Services, which reviews documentation and issues accommodation letters.\n\u2022 Common accommodations include extended test time, note-taking support, alternative formats for course materials, adaptive technology, and adjustments to classroom environment or deadlines.\n\u2022 Faculty receive the accommodation letter and collaborate with the student and Accessibility Services to implement supports promptly.\n\u2022 All electronic course materials are evaluated against WCAG 2.1 AA standards before publication, and course sites undergo periodic accessibility checks.\n\u2022 Faculty complete mandatory annual training on ADA and Section 504 responsibilities.\n\u2022 The policy and associated procedures are reviewed each year, with updates communicated to faculty and staff.\n\u2022 Students may pursue an internal grievance process overseen by the Vice-Provost\u2019s office if they believe accommodations are insufficient.\n\nWe continuously monitor these processes to ensure full alignment with ADA, Section 504, and other federal guidelines. Please let me know if you would like additional documentation or a meeting to discuss any aspect in more depth.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn\nProfessor, Grandview University",
