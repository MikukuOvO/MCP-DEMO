  "email_content": "Dear CodeCrafters Team,\n\nAs requested, please find below a consolidated overview of the information you need for the Trustworthy Banking Group software upgrade:\n\n1. Customer Satisfaction\n\u2022 Recent surveys indicate that more than four-fifths of our customers are satisfied with our services. The main strengths highlighted were staff friendliness and service efficiency. Key improvement areas include reducing wait times and strengthening online capabilities.\n\n2. Branch Performance Metrics\n\u2022 Overall branch performance in the most recent quarter improved by about five percent compared to the previous quarter, with customer satisfaction levels at roughly nine out of ten. Key performance indicators remain on target across all locations.\n\n3. Internal Audit Findings\n\u2022 Our latest internal audit identified some process inconsistencies in account reconciliation, documentation completeness, and electronic audit trails. Corrective action plans have already been implemented, with additional staff training and upgraded procedures now in place. The audit did not reveal any systemic security threats to the core banking platform.\n\n4. Current Digital Infrastructure\n\u2022 We currently operate a centralized legacy database that processes all customer transactions and stores data. The forthcoming upgrade aims to boost security features and transaction processing speed.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further detail or would like to schedule a call to discuss any aspect in depth.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\nBank Manager | Trustworthy Banking Group",
