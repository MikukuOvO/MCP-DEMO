  "email_content": "Hi TechMed Solutions Team,\n\nThank you for inviting me to contribute frontline feedback to guide the next version of the dispatch platform. Based on daily field use and our recent conversations, here are the capabilities that would make the biggest difference for EMT crews:\n\n1. Instant Status Updates\n   \u2022 Sub-minute refresh of unit location, assignment status, and ETA, even during high-call volumes.\n   \u2022 Live push notifications for any changes (e.g., reroute, upgraded priority).\n\n2. Mobile-First & Offline Support\n   \u2022 Light, responsive mobile app that works seamlessly on tablets and phones.\n   \u2022 Ability to continue viewing the call card and add time-stamps or notes while offline, with automatic sync once connectivity returns.\n\n3. Integrated Equipment Availability Lookup\n   \u2022 One-tap check of what specialty gear (e.g., ventilators, pediatric kits) is on board each responding unit.\n   \u2022 Flag when required items are not available so logistics can dispatch the nearest equipped resource.\n\n4. Protocol & Policy Updates in App\n   \u2022 Dedicated pane where medical directors can publish protocol revisions or drug-dose changes.\n   \u2022 Visual \u201cnew/updated\u201d tags so crews know they are working from the latest guidance.\n\n5. Customizable Reporting & Analytics\n   \u2022 Drag-and-drop report builder to let supervisors track metrics such as chute time, on-scene time, and turnaround.\n   \u2022 Scheduled exports in CSV/PDF for periodic reviews.\n\n6. Seamless Integrations\n   \u2022 APIs or native connectors for our ePCR (electronic patient care record), inventory platform, and CAD so data flows in both directions.\n   \u2022 Single sign-on to cut down on credential juggling.\n\n7. Streamlined Patient Information Interface\n   \u2022 Compact, read-only view of critical patient data (age, primary complaint, hazards) that surfaces automatically when the call is accepted.\n   \u2022 Role-based access controls to stay compliant with privacy regulations.\n\n8. Hands-Free / Voice Option\n   \u2022 Simple voice commands (acknowledge call, update status, open directions) that allow medics to keep eyes on the road and hands on the wheel.\n\nI\u2019m happy to elaborate or walk through use-case scenarios at your convenience. Thanks again for partnering with us to build a solution that truly supports crews in the field.\n\nBest regards,\nJane Doe\nEmergency Medical Technician\nMetro Emergency Response",
