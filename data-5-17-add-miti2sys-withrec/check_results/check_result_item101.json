  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nThanks for reaching out and for your interest in the Titans\u2019 run-up to the championship. I\u2019m happy to share a quick look at how we\u2019re preparing:\n\n\u2022 Elevated training intensity \u2013 We\u2019ve added extra conditioning and position-specific strength work, and the squad\u2019s stamina and explosiveness are trending in the right direction.\n\n\u2022 Emphasis on cohesion \u2013 Additional practice blocks are dedicated to communication, quick decision-making and situational drills so that every player can read and react together. The result has been crisper ball movement and a faster overall tempo during scrimmages.\n\n\u2022 Flexible tactical planning \u2013 We\u2019re spending a lot of time in the film room and on the field rehearsing multiple game scenarios. The players are getting comfortable creating space in transition while staying compact defensively when needed.\n\n\u2022 Holistic readiness \u2013 Our performance staff has woven recovery, mindfulness and visualization into the weekly routine to make sure the team arrives fresh, focused and mentally sharp.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like any further detail or direct quotes for your piece. I\u2019m glad to help.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\nTitans Coaching Staff",
