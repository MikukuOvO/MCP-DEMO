  "email_content": "Dear SecureTech Solutions Team,\n\nI hope you are well. Please find below the key information required to proceed with the biometric scanner installation at Heathrow International Terminal:\n\n1. Hardware / Software Specifications\n   \u2022 High-resolution fingerprint recognition (\u2265 99.8% accuracy)\n   \u2022 Integrated facial-recognition with low-light support\n   \u2022 Full compatibility with our current security platform (software v3.2.1)\n   \u2022 Operating temperature range: \u201310 \u00b0C to 50 \u00b0C\n   \u2022 Recommended model: SecureScan X2000 (USB 3.0 & Ethernet, AES-256 encryption, ISO/IEC 19794-2 & FIPS 201 compliant)\n\n2. Installation & System Update Steps\n   \u2022 Install scanners at the designated access control points and power them on.\n   \u2022 Connect each unit to the AeroSecure network and verify network communication.\n   \u2022 Register each scanner\u2019s device ID in the AeroSecure console so that the terminal access system recognizes the new hardware.\n   \u2022 After registration, run the built-in calibration/diagnostic routine and confirm successful completion.\n\n3. Temporary System Credentials\n   \u2022 Default administrator password (initial login only): Secure*987\n   \u2022 IMPORTANT: This password is provided solely to enable first-time configuration. Please change it immediately once all devices are online and verified.\n\n4. Next Steps & Support\n   \u2022 Once installation is finished and the credentials are updated, please send a brief confirmation so we can schedule the acceptance test.\n   \u2022 If any additional documentation or assistance is required, feel free to contact me directly.\n\nThank you for your support on this project. I look forward to a smooth installation and successful deployment.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJane Smith\nAirport Design Engineer \u2013 Security Systems\nHeathrow International Terminal\n",
