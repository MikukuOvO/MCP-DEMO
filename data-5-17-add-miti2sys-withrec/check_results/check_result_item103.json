I wanted to share a quick update on what we\u2019ve been up to at St. Mary\u2019s and outline the next steps for our joint charity event coming up in mid-March.\n\nRecent Parish Activities\n\u2022 Community Meal Program \u2013 Our volunteers continue to serve weekly dinners to neighbors in need, and attendance has been steadily growing.\n\u2022 Youth Mentorship Workshops \u2013 The parish youth group recently held two skills-building sessions that were very well received.\n\u2022 Winter Clothing Drive \u2013 Thanks to generous donations, we distributed several large bundles of coats and warm gear through local shelters.\n\nUpcoming Charity Event (mid-March)\n\u2022 Focus: A day of community service and engagement with activity stations such as meal-packing, hygiene-kit assembly, and a neighborhood cleanup.\n\u2022 Volunteers: We expect around 80 parish volunteers and would love to integrate Helping Hands teams at each station.\n\u2022 Stewardship: We\u2019re putting clear documentation procedures in place for all funds and in-kind donations so everything remains fully transparent.\n\u2022 Next Steps: Could we schedule a brief call next week to discuss resource needs, promotional materials, and volunteer sign-ups?\n\nYour partnership is invaluable, and I\u2019m excited to work together to make this event meaningful for the community.\n\nThanks, and I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nBlessings,\nJohn\nSt. Mary\u2019s Parish",
