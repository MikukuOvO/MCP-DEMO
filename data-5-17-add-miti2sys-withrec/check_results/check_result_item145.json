  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nThank you for reaching out about student engagement in our classes. I appreciate the chance to compare notes and learn from each other.\n\nBelow are a few approaches that have been working well on my end lately:\n\u2022 Begin with a thought-provoking question \u2013 opening each session with a brief prompt gets everyone thinking right away and frames the day\u2019s discussion.\n\u2022 Connect theory to lived experience \u2013 using recent news items or local case studies has sparked livelier exchanges and helped students see relevance beyond the classroom.\n\u2022 Student-led segments \u2013 inviting small groups to facilitate part of the conversation or present a related example increases ownership and keeps the energy up.\n\u2022 Quick pulse checks \u2013 a one-minute reflection poll or exit ticket at the end of class gives real-time insights into where students are engaged or confused.\n\u2022 Break-out discussions \u2013 short, focused small-group work lets quieter students contribute before we reconvene as a class.\n\nOn the assessment side, I\u2019ve been running a brief mid-term pulse survey to gauge engagement and adjust activities accordingly. If you\u2019re interested, I\u2019m happy to share the aggregated results once this semester\u2019s survey closes.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear what you\u2019ve found effective as well. Perhaps we could set up a short meeting or even co-host a teaching workshop for the department.\n\nLet me know what you think, and thanks again for starting this conversation.\n\nBest,\nJane",
