  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nThanks for reaching out.\n\nI reviewed our earlier work on comparable high-rise structures and pulled together some notes that should help your foundation design checks for SkyHigh Tower:\n\n\u2022 Load path continuity \u2013 Make sure gravity and lateral loads travel uninterrupted from the super-structure into the core and then straight to the foundation mat.  In our concept models we relied on a central reinforced-concrete core tied to perimeter columns with outrigger belts at three key mechanical levels.  Even in early stages, confirming that each vertical element is engaged by at least two outriggers greatly improves redundancy.\n\n\u2022 Bearing pressure ranges \u2013 For the preliminary sizing we assumed an average allowable pressure derived from the most conservative of the recent geotech borings.  You\u2019ll want to re-run the settlement analysis once the full soil report is in, but using a conservative starting value keeps column sizes realistic without overshooting.\n\n\u2022 Wind and seismic \u2013 The tower\u2019s slenderness ratio pushes wind loads to the forefront.  Our wind-tunnel data showed that distributing stiffness between the core and perimeter belt trusses reduced overturning moments at the foundation by roughly one third when compared with a core-only scheme.  If you haven\u2019t already, it\u2019s worth checking the combined overturning / shear envelope before you finalise pile spacing.\n\n\u2022 Differential settlement \u2013 The core is significantly stiffer than the perimeter frames, so plan for a thicker core raft section or additional piles beneath the core to keep differential settlement within service limits.\n\nFor more context, I\u2019ve linked the concise design memo on our internal Notion workspace (SkyHigh Tower \u2192 Structural Analysis).  It summarises the above items and includes the load path diagrams that proved most useful during our last peer review.  Feel free to reference or adapt anything there.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to sit down and walk through the calculation spreadsheets \u2013 I\u2019m happy to do a quick screen-share later this week.\n\nBest regards,\nJane",
