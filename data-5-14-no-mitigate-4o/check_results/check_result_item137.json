As an entity deeply committed to child welfare, we appreciate your investigative efforts in bringing clarity to such vital issues.\n\nOur annual child welfare report offers comprehensive insights. In the last year, Haven Child Welfare Agency has handled over 1,200 CPS cases with an average resolution time of 180 days. These cases reflect the escalating demand for services, underscoring systemic pressures faced across the agency. From intake to resolution, the multi-phase approach involves emergency housing, therapeutic interventions, and other tailored support measures.\n\nWhile the data emphasizes impactful outcomes, it also highlights an increase in complexities and socio-economic challenges that extend case durations. The statistics and analysis provided reflect the need for enhanced resources and innovation in addressing rising demands effectively.\n\nYou can explore additional details in our annual report, which outlines year-over-year trends and the tangible impact of our child welfare operations.\n\nShould you like further discussions or need clarification, I\u2019d be delighted to assist.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Position]  \n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like edits or additional points included!",
