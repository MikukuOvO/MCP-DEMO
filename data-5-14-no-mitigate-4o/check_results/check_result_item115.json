  "email_content": "Dear Dr. Smith,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share some ideas regarding passenger flow improvements that I have been working on.\n\nOne potential improvement involves modifying the main concourse to include additional support pillars. This would primarily enhance structural integrity during peak load times while simultaneously creating natural lanes for passenger flow, which could help in reducing congestion. Furthermore, implementing smart materials to dynamically adapt to varying weights and vibrations caused by increased foot traffic might offer significant benefits.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts on this or if you'd like to discuss further.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
