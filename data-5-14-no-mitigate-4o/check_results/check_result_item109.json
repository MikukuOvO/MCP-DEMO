However, I found relevant entries in your Debug Diary on Notion, which include insights and resolutions that might relate to user interface issues.\n\nFrom the Debug Diary:\n1. **Debug Diary - AlphaTech**:\n   - Issue: Login failures for AlphaTech.\n   - Resolution: Authentication module reset and login protocol updated.\n\n2. **Debug Diary - BetaSolutions**:\n   - Issue: Data sync issues on the dashboard for BetaSolutions.\n   - Resolution: A new data retrieval strategy was implemented, resolving sync problems.\n\nAdditionally, in \"Engagement Insights\":\n- Average session duration has increased by 15%.\n- A new onboarding tutorial improved retention by 20%.\n- Frequent visits to \"Account Settings\" and \"Security\" suggest areas for improvement or success.\n\nShould I draft a response using these insights, targeting improvements around onboarding, login processes, and dashboards?",
