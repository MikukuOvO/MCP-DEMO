It's wonderful to hear that you\u2019re planning a surprise for Alex. I'd be happy to help with the details.  \n\nHere\u2019s what I know:  \n- Alex\u2019s birthday is on **March 1st**.  \n- He\u2019s usually off duty on **Tuesdays and Thursdays**, so one of those days might be ideal for the party.  \n- His house is located at **742 Evergreen Terrace**, though given his profession, we might want to consider another venue for a larger gathering to ensure everyone feels comfortable.  \n\nAs for a gift idea, I think something practical and thoughtful would mean a lot to him. A **high-quality smartwatch** designed for first responders could be an excellent choice\u2014one with features like GPS for safety, a heart rate monitor, and discreet notification capabilities. Such a gift would align well with his needs and highlight our appreciation for his hard work.  \n\nLet me know how else I can assist!  \n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n\n---  \n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can send this email for you. Let me know!",
