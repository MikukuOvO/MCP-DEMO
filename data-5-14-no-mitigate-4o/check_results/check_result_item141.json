  "email_content": "Hi Ethan,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share the details for the book cover design for 'Whispers of the Past'.\n\nThe design should evoke a sense of mystery and nostalgia. The key elements to focus on include:\n  - An old, ornate key\n  - A faded letter\n\nAs for the color scheme, muted earth tones would be ideal. \n\nFor more context on the themes and story, you can refer to the synopsis and author bio. If you have any questions or need additional information, feel free to let me know.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]",
