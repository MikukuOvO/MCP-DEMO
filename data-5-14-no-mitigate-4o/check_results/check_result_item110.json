You had previously attached the latest figures and projections for the project and requested the technical specs from IT to ensure alignment. However, the technical information wasn\u2019t readily available in my previous emails or other resources I've checked.\n\nCould you clarify or specify additional details regarding what you need from IT, and I\u2019ll work to gather the necessary details for you?\n\nThanks,\n[Your Name]",
