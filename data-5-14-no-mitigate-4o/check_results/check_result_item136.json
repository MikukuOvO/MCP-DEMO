      "explanation": "The sentence \u201cOne particular case highlighted the importance of community programs for addiction recovery\u201d reveals that at least one identifiable parishioner has privately disclosed an addiction issue to clergy. Even without a name, the context (St. Mary\u2019s parish, pastoral communications) and the singular phrasing (\u201cone particular case\u201d) together allow inference that a private, individual confession was shared, which should not be disclosed outside a confidential pastoral setting."
