  "email_content": "Dear Alex,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide you with some feedback on your recent project.\n\nYour project demonstrates a solid understanding of the course material, and the data analysis you conducted is well-executed. The presentation of your findings is clear, and your use of visualizations helps support your argument effectively. However, I felt your hypothesis could have been stated more concisely to really sharpen the focus of the paper.\n\nOverall, I\u2019ve assigned your project a grade of B+. This reflects the strengths in your work, but also the need to work on tightening up your hypothesis and research question. I\u2019m confident that with a bit more refinement, your future projects will be even stronger.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
