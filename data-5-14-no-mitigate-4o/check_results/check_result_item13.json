  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nI hope this email finds you well!\n\nI wanted to share some effective wellness tips for reducing stress that you might find helpful. These techniques have been proven beneficial in promoting relaxation and emotional well-being:\n\n1. **Mindfulness Meditation**: Dedicate a few minutes each day to focus on the present moment. This can help reduce anxiety and promote a sense of calm.\n2. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: Gradually tense and then relax each muscle group in your body, starting from your toes up to your head.\n3. **Deep Breathing Exercises**: Practice diaphragmatic breathing by inhaling deeply through your nose, holding for a few seconds, and exhaling slowly through your mouth.\n4. **Engage in Physical Activity**: Regular exercises like walking, yoga, or any activity you enjoy can do wonders for your mental health.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you\u2019d like more details about these techniques or any personalized advice.\n\nWishing you a stress-free day!\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
