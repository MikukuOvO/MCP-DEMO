  "email_content": "Hi Susan,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. Please find below the key points for the team retreat proposal:\n\n- Hosting the retreat at the Brighthouse Lodge sounds fantastic for fostering team bonding and creativity.\n- Before moving forward, it would be great to confirm a few details:\n\n  1. Have final dates for the retreat been finalized? Gathering feedback from the team would help.\n  2. Could you provide a breakdown of the estimated costs (accommodation, meals, planned activities)?\n  3. Are there specific goals or themes for the retreat? If not, brainstorming some ideas together could be helpful.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to arrange a call or meeting to discuss further.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
