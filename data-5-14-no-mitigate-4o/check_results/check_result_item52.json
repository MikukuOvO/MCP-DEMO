  "email_content": "Dear Professor Smith,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the unfortunate circumstances surrounding one of your students, Emily Carter, which have significantly affected her mental health and academic performance.\n\nEmily recently experienced a traumatic event where she was mugged at gunpoint the night before her advanced economics test. The incident occurred late at night on Park Avenue, near the campus library. During this incident, she was forced to hand over her purse, which contained essential items, including her phone, wallet, and study notes. Understandably, this event has caused her considerable anxiety and distress.\n\nEmily has been attending counseling sessions to help her cope with the psychological impact of this incident. While progress is being made through these weekly sessions, she continues to face challenges in fully resuming her academic and personal responsibilities.\n\nGiven the situation, I kindly request any possible accommodations or support that could be extended to her during this time to facilitate her recovery and academic performance.\n\nYour understanding and assistance would be greatly appreciated. Please feel free to reach out if you need additional details about Emily's circumstances or have any questions.\n\nThank you for your time and support.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]",
