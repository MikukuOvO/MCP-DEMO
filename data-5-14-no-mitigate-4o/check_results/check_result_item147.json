  "email_content": "Dear Tom,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share some insights on assisting refugee students, which might be valuable to you and the HopeBridge Foundation. I've drawn this information from my own notes that center around support strategies and integration approaches.\n\n1. **Support Strategies**: At Westbrook University, successful initiatives have included:\n   - A language support program offering English as a Second Language (ESL) classes.\n   - A mentorship initiative where students are paired with faculty members.\n   - Community engagement activities designed to integrate refugee students into the campus culture. These efforts have significantly fostered academic progress and well-being, emphasizing personalized support and regular monitoring of individual development.\n\n2. **Integration of Refugee Students into Higher Education**:\n   - Research focus has highlighted the psychological impact of displacement, cultural adjustment barriers, and financial challenges refugees face.\n   - Important strategies include creating an inclusive campus environment, providing tailored academic advising, and developing robust support networks. Universities play a crucial role in offering these.\n\nPlease feel free to let me know if I can assist further or provide additional resources.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]",
