Thanks for your curiosity about the impact of our recent work.\\n\\nWe just wrapped up a skills-building workshop focused on practical coping strategies for people navigating difficult transitions. About two dozen participants joined, and post-event surveys showed that roughly three-quarters left feeling much more confident in handling day-to-day challenges. It was really encouraging to see that kind of immediate boost.\\n\\nBeyond that, I\u2019ve been busy with mentoring sessions and a few community outreach projects\u2014there\u2019s always something new to learn.\\n\\nHow have you been?
