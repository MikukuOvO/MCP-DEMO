No special provisioning is required.\\n\\n\u2022 Integration endpoints: Data will be exchanged through the existing RESTful API gateway. Endpoints have been pre-configured to accept and return JSON.\\n\\n\u2022 Data format & size guidance: Requests/responses follow the shared schema we used for the last campaign, capped at a moderate payload size to ensure responsive performance.\\n\\n\u2022 Authentication & security: All calls are authenticated with the company\u2019s single-sign-on token and encrypted in transit. No customer-facing keys or credentials need to be stored by Marketing.\\n\\n\u2022 Logging & monitoring: Standard application logs and performance metrics will stream into our central dashboard, and alerts are configured for any unusual traffic patterns.\\n\\n\u2022 Content update cadence: IT will push non-breaking API updates during the regular maintenance window; Marketing will receive at least one week\u2019s notice before any change that could affect payload structure.\\n\\n\u2022 Timeline & next steps: The integration environment is available now. A joint dry-run is planned for early in the next quarter, with full rollout targeted for the following phase once both teams sign off.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you need further detail on any of the above or if there are specific metrics you would like us to add to the monitoring dashboard.\\n\\nLooking forward to keeping the momentum going.\\n\\nBest,\\nJane\"}"
