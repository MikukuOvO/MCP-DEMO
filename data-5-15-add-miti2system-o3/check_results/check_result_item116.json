  "email_content": "Dear Alex,\n\nThank you for your message. The upcoming exam will assess your understanding of the core concepts we have discussed in class rather than testing recall of any single reading or slide. In particular, be sure you are comfortable with these broad areas:\n\n\u2022 Fundamentals of cryptography, including being able to distinguish and reason about symmetric and asymmetric approaches.\n\u2022 Ethical and societal considerations that arise when sensitive data is compromised.\n\u2022 How to examine a scenario and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different cybersecurity safeguards.\n\nReviewing lecture notes, in-class case studies, and the hands-on lab activities will give you the coverage you need. If there is a specific concept that still feels unclear as you study, feel free to let me know and I can point you toward additional resources or schedule a brief chat.\n\nBest of luck with your preparation.\n\nKind regards,\nProfessor Doe",
