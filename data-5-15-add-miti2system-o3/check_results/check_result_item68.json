  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well! I wanted to share a quick update on our most recent admissions cycle:\n\n\u2022 Applications rose noticeably, making this one of our most competitive years so far.\n\u2022 We admitted a smaller percentage of applicants, reflecting the heightened selectivity.\n\u2022 The incoming class boasts very strong academic profiles and represents students from dozens of countries, giving us our most globally diverse cohort to date.\n\nEveryone here is excited about the energy and perspectives this group will bring to campus.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like any additional details. Always happy to keep you in the loop.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
