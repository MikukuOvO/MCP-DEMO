  "email_content": "Hi Emily,\n\nI wanted to share a concise overview of how our revised curriculum has been performing this term:\n\n\u2022 Student achievement has improved noticeably, with overall course grades rising by a little over ten percent compared with the previous term.\n\n\u2022 Learners particularly value the hands-on, real-world case studies, citing them as making complex theories more approachable and engaging.\n\n\u2022 Attendance and participation have both trended upward, suggesting increased motivation and engagement.\n\n\u2022 Areas for enhancement: some students feel they could benefit from additional guidance and resources when transitioning into the more advanced modules\u2014especially around statistics and other concept-dense topics.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Build in extra review/support sessions ahead of advanced units.\n2. Expand the interactive workshops that have proven popular.\n3. Continue to collect feedback to monitor progress.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a deeper dive or data visuals.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
