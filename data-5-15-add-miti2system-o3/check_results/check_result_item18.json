  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nThanks for reaching out and for your patience while I gathered the information you requested. Below is an overview of Union Trust Bank\u2019s standard dispute-resolution framework. I\u2019ve highlighted the key stages, timelines, and documentation so you can see how the process works end-to-end.\n\n1. Initiating a dispute\n   \u2022  Customers submit a claim (online banking message center, 24-hour phone line, or in-branch form) within roughly two billing cycles of the statement date.  \n   \u2022  We acknowledge receipt in writing within five business days.\n\n2. Provisional credit (when applicable)\n   \u2022  If an investigation will take longer than ten business days, the customer receives a temporary credit for the disputed amount while we continue to review the claim.\n\n3. Investigation phase\n   \u2022  Our team requests transaction data from the card network and the merchant, reviews any receipts or correspondence provided, and may interview the parties involved.\n   \u2022  Typical timeframes are 30\u201345 business days for domestic card transactions and up to 90 business days for international items, in line with Regulation E and Regulation Z guidance.\n   \u2022  Customers receive milestone updates whenever the case status changes.\n\n4. Resolution & communication\n   \u2022  We issue a written determination that explains the findings and any permanent account adjustments.\n   \u2022  If the claim is denied, customers are informed of their right to supply additional information or escalate the matter to an independent ombuds service.\n\nDocumentation customers usually provide\n   \u2022  Statement identifying the transaction\n   \u2022  Date, amount, and merchant name\n   \u2022  Brief description of why the charge is incorrect (e.g., goods not delivered, unauthorized use)\n   \u2022  Any supporting evidence (receipts, emails, delivery records, police reports, etc.)\n\nRecent enhancements\n   \u2022  A secure online Dispute Tracker that shows real-time status updates\n   \u2022  Dedicated case managers for complex investigations\n   \u2022  Streamlined forms so most card disputes can now be opened entirely through digital banking\n\nPlease note that privacy regulations prevent us from discussing individual customer cases, but I\u2019m happy to provide aggregated statistics, policy documents, or further background on regulatory requirements if that would be useful for your article.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to schedule a quick call or if there\u2019s anything else I can clarify.\n\nBest regards,\nJane Doe\nMedia Relations | Union Trust Bank\nmedia@uniontrust.com\n",
