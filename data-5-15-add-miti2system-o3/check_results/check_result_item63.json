  "email_content": "Dear Dr. Smith,\n\nI hope you are well. I\u2019m writing to share a concise overview of our latest findings on how passengers perceive public spaces in transport environments.\n\n\u2022 Empathy and stress reduction: Feedback indicates that environments designed with calming visuals, clear signage, and respectful interactions help lower passengers\u2019 stress and anxiety, particularly at security checkpoints.\n\n\u2022 Personalization and dignity: Travelers appreciate procedures that acknowledge individual needs and privacy, such as flexible screening lanes and discreet secondary inspections.\n\n\u2022 Holistic safety measures: Participants emphasized that feelings of safety extend beyond primary checkpoints to ancillary areas such as restrooms and waiting zones. A visible yet unobtrusive security presence and well-lit, open layouts were frequently cited as positive factors.\n\n\u2022 Design recommendations: Incorporating natural elements, comfortable seating, and intuitive wayfinding can improve overall satisfaction. Additionally, training staff in empathetic communication further enhances perceptions of care and professionalism.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like a more detailed breakdown or to discuss these insights further.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n",
