  "email_content": "Hi Lisa,\n\nWelcome aboard! I wanted to pass along some key insights that should make your first days with Ethan smoother:\n\n\u2022 Communication & Comfort: He benefits from a predictable routine and responds well to gentle reminders. Offering short \u201cbreak\u201d options when activities feel overwhelming helps him stay calm and engaged.\n\n\u2022 Preferred Activities: Ethan loves anything animal-related, water play, and creative art projects. Puzzles are also a favorite and can be a great way to settle into focused time.\n\n\u2022 Mealtimes: Warm, simple foods work best. Crunchy snacks like apple slices with peanut butter are hits, and a quiet environment during meals keeps him relaxed.\n\n\u2022 Daily Rhythm (approximate): Morning \u2013 breakfast and light activities, late morning \u2013 focused play such as puzzles, midday \u2013 lunch followed by quiet reading or music, afternoon \u2013 therapy/outdoor time, evening \u2013 dinner and a nature show, then an early bedtime.\n\n\u2022 Positive Reinforcement: Praise and visual cues go a long way. Celebrating small wins (for example, when he initiates play or asks for a break) really motivates him.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out if any questions come up or you\u2019d like more details.\n\nThanks so much for supporting Ethan!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
