I\u2019ve been reviewing some of our recent brainstorming notes and past conversations, and I\u2019d love to connect to explore fresh ways we can strengthen Community United\u2019s donation efforts.\n\nHere are a few ideas I think could make a meaningful difference:\n\u2022 Introduce a recurring\u2010giving option so supporters can sign up for modest monthly gifts.\n\u2022 Launch a donor\u2010recognition program that highlights contributors on our website and social media.\n\u2022 Run a short, engaging social\u2010media challenge that encourages younger audiences to participate and share.\n\u2022 Pilot a crowdfunding campaign with built-in social-sharing tools to reach new networks.\n\u2022 Offer alternative giving methods\u2014such as digital wallets or crypto\u2014so donors can contribute in whatever way is most convenient for them.\n\u2022 Partner with local businesses for in-kind contributions or percentage-of-sales days that benefit Community United.\n\nI\u2019d appreciate hearing your thoughts and learning what initiatives are already on the horizon for your team. If you\u2019re available, perhaps we could schedule a brief call in the next week or two to compare notes and map out next steps.\n\nThank you for all that you and Community United do. I look forward to collaborating!\n\nBest regards,\nJohn",
