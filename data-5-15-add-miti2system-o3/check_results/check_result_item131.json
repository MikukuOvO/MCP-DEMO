  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I wanted to share a brief update on our student volunteer\u2019s involvement with Helping Hands Foundation.\n\n\u2022 Commitment: The student has continued to attend each outreach session regularly, often arriving early to help with set-up and staying afterward for clean-up.\n\u2022 Initiative: They have recently taken the lead on organizing activity stations during weekend events and have been quick to step into new roles whenever extra assistance is needed.\n\u2022 Peer Support: New volunteers consistently mention how welcomed and prepared they feel thanks to the student\u2019s guidance and positive attitude.\n\nOverall, their dedication and professionalism have made a noticeable difference, and their contribution is highly valued by everyone on site.\n\nPlease let me know if you\u2019d like any additional information or if there are new areas where the student could focus their efforts.\n\nThank you for your continued partnership.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
