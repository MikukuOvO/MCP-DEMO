I\u2019m writing to outline the core requirements and proposed timeline for the Performance Tracking System (PTS) so our teams can stay aligned as development ramps up.\n\nKey Functional Requirements\n\u2022 Real-Time Performance Metrics \u2013 The platform should present up-to-the-minute KPIs such as project completion rates, sales-target attainment, and customer-service response times.\n\u2022 Customizable Dashboards \u2013 End users need the ability to tailor dashboards so the most relevant metrics for their roles are front and center.\n\u2022 HR System Integration \u2013 The PTS must connect smoothly with Acme Corp\u2019s existing HRIS to provide a unified view of training records, role changes, and performance reviews.\n\nHigh-Level Timeline\n\u2022 Development start: next quarter\n\u2022 Pilot phase: six months following development kickoff, during which we\u2019ll refine features based on user feedback\n\nNext Steps\n1. Please confirm that the above requirements reflect your current understanding.\n2. Let us know of any additional technical specifications or dependencies we should address before sprint planning begins.\n3. If helpful, we can schedule a brief sync early next week to walk through the system architecture in more detail.\n\nThank you for your partnership. Looking forward to collaborating on a successful launch.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Position]\n[Your Company]\n",
