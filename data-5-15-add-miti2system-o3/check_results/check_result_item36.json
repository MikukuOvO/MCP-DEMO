  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nThanks for reaching out. I understand the concerns that rumors can raise, so I wanted to clarify what\u2019s actually happening.\n\nThere are no major structural changes or layoffs planned. The primary initiative underway is a set of TeamBoost Workshops that focus on strengthening collaboration and efficiency across teams. These workshops are part of our ongoing commitment to professional development and are not tied to any reorganization or downsizing.\n\nLeadership has assured us that if any significant changes were ever on the horizon, everyone would be informed well in advance. As it stands, your role\u2014and the entire team\u2019s positions\u2014remain secure.\n\nI hope this helps put your mind at ease. If you have any other questions or want to chat further, just let me know.\n\nBest,\nJane",
