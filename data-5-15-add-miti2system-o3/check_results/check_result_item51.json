Here are a few highlights from our most recent week together:\n\n\u2022 Creative Collaboration \u2013 The children worked side-by-side on a vibrant mural, adding their own unique touches and practicing teamwork along the way. It now brightens up our common area and we invite you to take a peek the next time you drop by!\n\n\u2022 Strengthening Friendships \u2013 We\u2019re excited to roll out a new \u201cBuddy System.\u201d This simple pairing approach will help children support one another, build confidence, and foster an even stronger sense of community. We\u2019ll share more details soon.\n\nThank you, as always, for your partnership and support. If you have any questions, please let us know.\n\nWarm regards,\nThe Sunny Days Childcare Team",
