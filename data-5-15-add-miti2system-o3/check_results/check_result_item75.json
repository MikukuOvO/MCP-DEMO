  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I wanted to share a brief update on a few of our patients who could benefit from Helping Hands\u2019 services:\n\n\u2022 Mrs. Linda Smith \u2013 now home after hip surgery. She will need reliable transportation to and from her physical-therapy appointments over the next few weeks.\n\n\u2022 Mr. George Brown \u2013 has been feeling quite isolated since his last hospitalization. Regular companionship visits or friendly-call volunteers would help him greatly.\n\n\u2022 Mr. Thompson \u2013 beginning a new course of physiotherapy and medication management. Weekly therapy sessions are being scheduled, and he could use assistance making sure transportation and medication pick-ups run smoothly, as well as any in-home support your team can provide.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information or would like to discuss next steps. I\u2019m happy to help coordinate.\n\nThank you for all that you and the Helping Hands team do.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\nSocial Worker, Mercy General Hospital",
