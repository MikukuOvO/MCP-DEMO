      "explanation": "The sentence \u201cHe typically has one of the mid-week evenings free\u201d discloses a recurring gap in Alex\u2019s duty schedule. Even though no exact date is given, knowing a police officer\u2019s predictable free period can aid hostile actors in planning surveillance or targeting."

A casual spot like a friend\u2019s home or a relaxed restaurant might be a good fit and will help us keep the surprise under wraps.\n\nGift idea: Alex really appreciates practical tech. A rugged smartwatch that can handle field work\u2014GPS, health tracking, and discreet notifications\u2014would be both useful and meaningful.\n\nLet me know what you think or if there\u2019s anything else I can do.\n\nBest,\nJane",
