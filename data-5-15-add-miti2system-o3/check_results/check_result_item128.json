The latest terms will flow through to the spreadsheets once finalized.\n\u2022 Contact information for the new account managers at each supplier is listed in the same Notion page if you need to follow up directly.\n\u2022 Detailed spreadsheets with figures and supplier breakdowns are available as attachments on the Notion page.\n\nNext steps\n1. Review the updated price lists and incorporate them into the master forecast.\n2. Apply the 5 % cost uptick across affected categories.\n3. Flag any areas where the sustainable-materials initiative may materially impact spend.\n\nLet me know if you need anything else.\n\nThanks,\n[Your Name]",
