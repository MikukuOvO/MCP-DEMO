  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nThank you for reaching out regarding the community\u2019s most urgent needs. From our latest assessments, three areas stand out:\n\n\u2022 Food support: Demand at the local food bank has risen by roughly one-fifth in recent months; shelf-stable items and volunteer distribution help are top priorities.\n\n\u2022 Mental-health resources: We\u2019re seeing more residents requesting affordable counseling and peer-support groups. Additional funding or partnerships with certified professionals would expand access.\n\n\u2022 Addiction recovery services: Substance-use challenges remain prevalent. Increasing the availability of recovery programs and family-support services would greatly help those seeking assistance.\n\nI\u2019d be glad to discuss collaboration opportunities or share further insights.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support of the community.\n\nBest regards,\n\nYour Name",
