  "email_content": "Hi Emily,\n\nIt was great meeting you recently. As promised, here are a few highlights from my creative writing class that I thought you might enjoy:\n\n\u2022 Opening Momentum \u2013 We practiced crafting first paragraphs that reveal a character\u2019s motivation right away, giving the reader a reason to lean in.\n\n\u2022 Rhythm & Pacing \u2013 Our instructor encouraged experimenting with sentence length: quick, punchy lines to build tension and longer, flowing sentences to invite reflection.\n\n\u2022 Sensory Layering \u2013 We challenged ourselves to weave in sound, smell, and texture alongside visuals so each scene feels multi-dimensional.\n\n\u2022 Earned Endings \u2013 A satisfying resolution grows logically from the characters\u2019 choices rather than a last-minute twist.\n\nI\u2019ve already started noticing how these small adjustments make drafts feel more alive. Let me know if any of these resonate with your own writing or reading. I\u2019d love to hear what you\u2019ve been working on.\n\nLooking forward to staying in touch.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
