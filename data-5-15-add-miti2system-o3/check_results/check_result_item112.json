Verify the customer\u2019s identity using the approved verification methods (e.g., two pieces of ID and the standard security questions).\n2. Log the inquiry in the CRM so the interaction is tracked from the start.\n3. Resolve the request if it falls within your authority and is covered by routine policy.\n4. For questions that require additional support or exceptions, create a ticket with our internal help desk (internal-help@trustwellbank.com) so the case can be routed to the right team.\n5. Once resolved, add a brief summary of the outcome to the CRM record so future interactions have the full context.\n\nIssue-reporting protocol\n\u2022 Capture a brief description of the problem, any relevant account details, and supporting documentation or screenshots.\n\u2022 Submit the information to the help desk using the same ticketing system noted above.\n\u2022 If the matter is time-sensitive, refer to the branch-manager contact list for a direct escalation channel.\n\nAdditional resources\n\u2022 \u201cBank Procedures Overview\u201d (internal wiki) \u2013 a quick refresher on the main steps and escalation paths.\n\u2022 The help-desk knowledge base \u2013 searchable articles that address common scenarios.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.
