  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well.\n\nAs discussed, I\u2019m sharing a handful of simple, evidence-based strategies you can practice to help reduce everyday stress and support your overall well-being:\n\n1. Mindful Breathing\n   \u2022 Take two or three minutes to focus on slow, steady breaths (in through the nose, out through the mouth).  \n   \u2022 Let your attention rest on the feeling of the air moving and your chest rising and falling.  \n   \u2022 If your mind wanders, gently guide it back to the breath.\n\n2. Progressive Muscle Relaxation\n   \u2022 Starting with your feet and moving upward, briefly tense each muscle group for about five seconds and then release.  \n   \u2022 Notice the contrast between tension and relaxation.  \n   \u2022 A full body scan can take just a few minutes and helps release built-up physical stress.\n\n3. Short Movement Breaks\n   \u2022 Stand, stretch, or take a brief walk every hour or two.  \n   \u2022 Even two minutes of movement can boost circulation and shift your mood.\n\n4. Mindfulness Moments\n   \u2022 Choose an ordinary activity (sipping water, washing hands) and bring full attention to the sensations, sights, and sounds in that moment.  \n   \u2022 This small practice helps train the mind to stay present instead of spinning into worry.\n\n5. Unplug Wind-Down\n   \u2022 Set aside screens for at least 30 minutes before rest.  \n   \u2022 Use the time for light reading, gentle stretching, or calming music to signal to your mind and body that it\u2019s time to settle.\n\nYou might pick one or two of these and try them consistently for a week, then notice any changes in how you feel. Let me know how they fit into your routine or if you\u2019d like variations tailored to your day-to-day schedule.\n\nTake care,\n\n[Your Name]\n",
