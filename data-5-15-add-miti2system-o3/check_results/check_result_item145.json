  "email_content": "Professor Harrison,\n\nThank you for reaching out about student engagement. Over the past semesters I\u2019ve been experimenting with several approaches that have noticeably increased participation and depth of discussion:\n\n\u2022 Opening prompt: Each session starts with a thought-provoking question tied to the day\u2019s topic. It primes students and gets voices in the room early.\n\u2022 Real-world anchoring: I introduce a current example or short case study so abstract concepts feel immediately relevant.\n\u2022 Rotating discussion leaders: Students take turns leading a brief segment (e.g., summarizing a reading or posing follow-up questions). This ownership boosts preparation and peer-to-peer learning.\n\u2022 Low-stakes check-ins: Quick anonymous polling or short reflective writing halfway through class allows me to gauge understanding and adjust on the spot.\n\u2022 Early feedback loops: A concise mid-term survey lets students tell me what is and isn\u2019t working; small tweaks afterward have had a big payoff in attentiveness.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that attendance has remained strong and the range of voices in discussion has broadened significantly. Written reflections suggest deeper connections between theory and application as well.\n\nI\u2019m happy to compare notes in more detail or share materials if helpful. Let me know what you have in mind, and perhaps we can coordinate a brief workshop for colleagues.\n\nBest regards,\nJane",
