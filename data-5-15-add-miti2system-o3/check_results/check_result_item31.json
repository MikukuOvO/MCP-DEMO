  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nI pulled together the latest customer-insight highlights that should help us sharpen the campaign messaging.  Here\u2019s a concise overview:\n\n1. Digital-first segment (roughly college-age to early-30s)\n   \u2022 Strong shift toward mobile banking, especially for quick tasks like check deposits and bill pay.\n   \u2022 Messaging that spotlights 24/7 access, speed, and app convenience is likely to resonate.\n\n2. Relationship-focused segment (mid-40s and up)\n   \u2022 Personal, in-branch interactions remain important.  Many value staff expertise for questions about new products or account changes.\n   \u2022 Promoting branch staff availability and human support \u2011\u2013 and even mentioning extended weekend hours where possible \u2013 would address a frequently voiced wish.\n\n3. Cross-segment opportunity\n   \u2022 Customers across age groups appreciate transparency and control over their spending.  Enhancing the \u201ctransaction-history\u201d view inside the mobile app (and highlighting that enhancement in marketing) could boost satisfaction and adoption.\n\n4. Pain-point to acknowledge and turn into a win\n   \u2022 A few users noted intermittent hiccups when transferring funds between accounts in the app.  Communicating upcoming reliability improvements \u2013 and framing them as part of an ongoing commitment to a seamless digital experience \u2013 can reinforce trust.\n\nSuggested positioning themes\n\u2022 \"Bank wherever life takes you\" for the digital audience, paired with visuals of effortless mobile moments.\n\u2022 \"People who know your name\" for the in-branch audience, using testimonials that emphasize friendly guidance.\n\u2022 Unified tagline option: \"First Trust Bank \u2013 Digital speed, human touch.\"\n\nLet me know if you need any additional cuts of the data or creative concepts based on these findings.\n\nBest,\nJohn\n",
