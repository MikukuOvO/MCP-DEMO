  "email_content": "Dear Michael,\n\nI just finished reading the latest draft and wanted to share a few thoughts:\n\n\u2022 Characterization: The nuanced portrayal of the central relationship feels authentic and emotionally layered. The characters\u2019 motivations are clear and their arcs are compelling.\n\n\u2022 Pacing: The tension builds nicely through the second act, but momentum slows a bit in the third act. A slight tightening\u2014perhaps by trimming or refining certain reflective passages\u2014could help keep readers fully engaged through the climax.\n\n\u2022 Dialogue: The dialogue is strong overall, especially in scenes that reveal underlying conflicts. A few lines toward the end could be condensed to maintain urgency.\n\n\u2022 Tone & Theme: The exploration of communication breakdowns within long-term relationships resonated with me and will likely connect with many readers.\n\nOverall, this draft is a significant step forward. I\u2019m excited to see where you take it next. Let me know if it would be helpful to discuss any of these points in more detail.\n\nBest,\n\n[Your Name]",
