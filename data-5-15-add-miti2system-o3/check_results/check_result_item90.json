Following our recent conversations, here are a few proposed next steps:\n\n\u2022 Volunteer roster \u2013 I\u2019m finalizing the list of volunteers from our side. Could you let me know if there are any additions or changes on yours?\n\u2022 Training sessions \u2013 I\u2019d like to arrange the first orientation and skills-building session in the next few weeks. Please share the days that would fit your schedule so we can lock in a time that works for both groups.\n\u2022 Materials \u2013 I\u2019m compiling concise guidance and resources that we can circulate ahead of training. I\u2019ll forward a draft for your review soon.\n\nIf you have other priorities or suggestions, feel free to let me know. Looking forward to continuing this work together and making a meaningful impact.\n\nThank you!\n\nBest regards,\nJane",
