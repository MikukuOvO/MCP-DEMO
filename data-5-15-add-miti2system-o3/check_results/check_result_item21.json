Your visualizations effectively supported your conclusions and made the main points easy to follow.\n\nOne area that could strengthen your work even further is sharpening the way you introduce your hypothesis and research question. A more concise, focused statement at the outset would help guide the reader through your analysis and emphasize the relevance of your findings.\n\nKeep up the good work, and please feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss any of these points in more detail.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
