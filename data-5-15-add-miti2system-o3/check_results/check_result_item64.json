  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nWelcome aboard! I wanted to give you a concise overview of where we stand on our primary matter (Case #7643):\n\n\u2022 Current Status: Following our recent strategy discussion, the team has aligned on a refined approach and individual responsibilities. All evidence gathered to date has been cataloged, reviewed, and independently verified.\n\n\u2022 Key Developments: We obtained additional supporting material last week that strengthens our liability argument. This does not alter the core theory of the case but gives us a stronger basis as we head into the next phase.\n\n\u2022 Next Steps:\n  \u2013 Draft motions are on track to be finalized soon.\n  \u2013 Deposition preparation is underway, with a mock session scheduled prior to our next internal milestone.\n  \u2013 We will reconvene in the coming weeks to finalize briefing strategy and address any discovery follow-ups.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like a more detailed briefing or have any immediate questions. I\u2019m happy to walk you through the finer points at your convenience.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn",
