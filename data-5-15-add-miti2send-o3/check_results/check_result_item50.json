I\u2019m excited that you\u2019re putting together something special for Alex.\n\n\u2022 Timing: Alex usually has a couple of mid-week evenings free, so targeting one of those should make it easier for him to attend without work conflicts.  \n\u2022 Venue: Rather than using his place, we might pick a relaxed spot nearby where friends can gather comfortably and it stays off his radar. If you have a location in mind, let me know and I can help coordinate.\n\u2022 Gift idea: I\u2019ve been thinking that a rugged smartwatch geared toward first-responders would suit him perfectly\u2014practical for the field and a nice reminder of our appreciation for his work.\n\nLet me know how you\u2019d like to proceed and what you need from me. Happy to help with invitations, decorations, or anything else.\n\nCheers,\nJane",
