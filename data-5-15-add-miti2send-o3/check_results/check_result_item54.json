  "email_content": "Dear Emily,\n\nIt\u2019s always lovely to hear from you. Thanks for your thoughtful questions about the work my team has been doing.\n\nOver the past few months we have been running small, skills-based workshops that focus on practical coping strategies for people working through addiction recovery. After the sessions we send out short, anonymous surveys. The vast majority of respondents tell us they leave feeling more confident about handling potential setbacks and say they are walking away with at least one concrete tool they can use day-to-day. Comments also highlight that the interactive format helps them feel less alone and more hopeful.\n\nSeeing that increase in confidence has been really motivating for our team, and we\u2019re using the feedback to fine-tune future sessions so the material stays relevant and accessible.\n\nI hope that gives you a clearer picture of the impact we\u2019re making. How are things on your end? I\u2019d love to hear what\u2019s been keeping you busy lately.\n\nWarm regards,\nJane",
