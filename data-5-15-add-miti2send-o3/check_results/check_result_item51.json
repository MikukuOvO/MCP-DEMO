Each child added their own unique touches to a colorful group mural that celebrates teamwork and friendship. We hope you\u2019ll enjoy seeing it displayed in the hallway.\n\n\u2022 Buddy System Coming Soon \u2013 To continue strengthening peer connections, we\u2019ll be launching a simple \u201cBuddy System.\u201d Children will be paired with a classmate for fun cooperative activities and gentle encouragement throughout the day. We\u2019ll send more details in the next newsletter.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support. Have a wonderful weekend!\n\nWarmly,\nThe Sunny Days Childcare Team",
