Below is a concise overview of our most recent donor-engagement metrics that should help inform plans for our next joint initiative:\n\n\u2022 Participation: Donor participation rose by roughly 15% over the same period last year, with the strongest lift during the latest giving season.\n\u2022 Conversion: A targeted email series to previous supporters achieved about a 20% conversion rate.\n\u2022 Growth trend: Both the donor base and total contributions have continued an upward trajectory for the past three years, driven largely by personalized outreach and matching-gift promotions.\n\u2022 Top-performing tactics:\n  \u2013 Personalized thank-you messages paired with impact stories.\n  \u2013 Limited-time matching-gift challenges.\n  \u2013 Social-media micro-campaigns spotlighting specific program outcomes.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a deeper dive into any of these areas or set up time to brainstorm how we can integrate these findings into our upcoming campaign.\n\nLooking forward to collaborating!\n\nBest regards,\nJohn",
