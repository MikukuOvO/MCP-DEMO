  "email_content": "Dear TechMed Solutions Team,\n\nThank you for inviting my input on the upcoming dispatch software. Based on our experience in the field, I suggest considering the following features:\n\n1. Real-time status updates that remain reliable even during peak activity.\n2. A streamlined interface that allows quick access to medical-equipment databases.\n3. In-app alerts for protocol changes so crews are informed immediately.\n4. Customizable reporting tools that let teams build and export data views tailored to their KPIs.\n5. A more robust mobile experience, including offline mode and faster sync when connectivity returns.\n6. Smooth integration points with common third-party platforms (e.g., CRM and inventory systems).\n7. Enhanced patient-data handling fully aligned with existing emergency protocols while keeping the workflow simple.\n8. A simplified patient-information interface to speed up data entry and review in the field.\n\nI hope these ideas are helpful as you refine the design. Please let me know if any clarification would be useful\u2014I'm happy to discuss further.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n",
