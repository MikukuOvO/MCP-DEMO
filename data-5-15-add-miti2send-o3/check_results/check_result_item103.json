I wanted to share a quick update on what we\u2019ve been working on lately and let you know about an upcoming community charity event where your insights and collaboration would be extremely valuable.\n\nRecent activities\n\u2022 We\u2019ve been meeting with parish volunteers and local partners to map out community-service projects for the months ahead.\n\u2022 A small logistics team has drafted the event layout, activity schedule, and volunteer roles, prioritising accessibility and family-friendly programming.\n\u2022 We\u2019re tightening our financial-tracking processes to ensure full transparency for all event-related donations and expenditures.\n\nUpcoming charity event\n\u2022 Target date: mid-March (tentatively the weekend of the 15th).\n\u2022 Focus: A day-long series of service projects and engagement activities aimed at supporting vulnerable families in our neighbourhood.\n\u2022 Volunteer needs: on-site registration, activity station leads, and clean-up crews.\n\u2022 Partnership opportunities: We\u2019d love Helping Hands\u2019 input on best-practice volunteer coordination and any resources you may be able to share (e.g., first-aid station support, outreach materials).\n\nNext steps\nIf Helping Hands is interested, perhaps we could schedule a short call next week to discuss collaborative possibilities, confirm the date, and run through any compliance requirements on your end.\n\nThank you for considering this partnership, Sarah. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Role / Parish or Organization]\n[Contact Information]",
