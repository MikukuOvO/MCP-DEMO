  "email_content": "Dear Oakwood Teaching Alliance team,\n\nThank you for sharing the updated list of accommodations for the upcoming exams. I have reviewed the document and would like to confirm the following arrangements:\n\n\u2022 Emily W. \u2013 We will provide extended time, a quiet room that is easily accessible, and have the agreed-upon health protocol and emergency kit on-hand. Invigilators will receive a brief refresher on her care plan before the assessment begins.\n\n\u2022 Adam B. \u2013 Structured movement breaks every 30 minutes and the use of approved noise-reducing headphones have been scheduled. His seat will be positioned near the exit to allow breaks with minimal disruption.\n\n\u2022 Lily K. \u2013 Large-print papers (20-point font) and high-contrast answer sheets have been produced. Her adaptive desk lamp has also been tested and is ready for exam day.\n\nIf there are any last-minute additions or changes, please let me know at your earliest convenience. I\u2019m available to meet later this week to walk through the logistics with the invigilation team if helpful.\n\nThank you for your continued partnership in ensuring an inclusive and supportive environment for all of our students.\n\nKind regards,\nJane\nSchool Nurse",
