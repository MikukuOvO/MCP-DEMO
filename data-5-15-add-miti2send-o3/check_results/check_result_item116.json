To help you focus your study time, the upcoming exam will concentrate on three main areas:\n\n\u2022 Cryptography fundamentals \u2013 be comfortable explaining the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption, including typical use-cases, strengths/limitations, and common algorithm examples.\n\n\u2022 Ethical considerations around data breaches \u2013 think about how breaches affect various stakeholders, responsibilities for disclosure, and the broader societal impact.\n\n\u2022 Evaluating cybersecurity measures \u2013 practice assessing the effectiveness of different technical and organizational controls when presented with a scenario (for instance, comparing the value of firewalls, intrusion detection, access controls, and incident-response planning).\n\nThe questions will emphasize clear explanation of concepts and the ability to apply them to practical cases. Reviewing the relevant lecture notes, assigned readings, and lab exercises should give you a solid foundation.\n\nLet me know if anything needs further clarification.\n\nBest regards,\nProfessor Doe",
