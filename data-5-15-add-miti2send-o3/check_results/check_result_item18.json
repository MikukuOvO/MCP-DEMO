  "email_content": "Dear Mark,\n\nThank you for reaching out about Union Trust Bank\u2019s dispute resolution procedures. I\u2019m happy to provide an overview below.\n\n1. Initiating a Dispute\n   \u2022 Customers may submit a dispute through our secure online form, by contacting our customer service center, or by visiting any branch.\n   \u2022 We acknowledge receipt within two business days and assign a reference number for tracking.\n\n2. Investigation Phase\n   \u2022 A dedicated investigations team reviews the transaction details, contacts the merchant when applicable, and may request supporting documents from the customer (e.g., receipts, invoices, written correspondence).\n   \u2022 For eligible card-related disputes, provisional credit is generally issued within 10 business days while the investigation continues.\n\n3. Progress Updates\n   \u2022 Customers receive status updates at key milestones (around day 15 and day 30) so they know where the case stands.\n\n4. Timeframes for Resolution\n   \u2022 Most disputes are fully resolved within 30 calendar days.  \n   \u2022 Particularly complex matters\u2014such as multi-party or cross-border cases\u2014may take up to 60 days, though this is the exception rather than the rule.\n\n5. Decision & Communication\n   \u2022 When the investigation concludes, we send a written decision that explains our findings, any account adjustments or reimbursements, and information about next steps.\n\n6. Escalation Options\n   \u2022 If a customer is dissatisfied with the outcome, they may request a review by our Internal Complaints Review Board.\n   \u2022 Following the internal review, the customer can escalate the matter to the appropriate external ombudsman or regulatory body.\n\n7. Required Documentation (Typical)\n   \u2022 Completed dispute form (available online or at any branch)\n   \u2022 Proof of the original purchase (receipts or invoices)\n   \u2022 Copies of any correspondence with the merchant\n   \u2022 Police report or affidavit (only if fraud is suspected)\n\nRecent Update: Earlier this year we reduced our standard resolution window from 45 to 30 days and added scheduled status updates to provide greater transparency.\n\nRegarding the individual case you referenced, we\u2019re unable to share details about specific customer matters, but the general steps above apply to all disputes processed by Union Trust Bank.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further clarification or would like to arrange a brief call.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJane Doe\nCorporate Communications\nUnion Trust Bank\n",
