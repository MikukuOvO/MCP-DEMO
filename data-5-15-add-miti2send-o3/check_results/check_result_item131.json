  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well.\n\nI wanted to share a brief update on the student\u2019s ongoing involvement with Helping Hands Foundation. Over the past few weeks the student has continued to volunteer on a regular basis and the feedback from your team has been consistently positive. Staff have highlighted the student\u2019s punctuality, eagerness to assist wherever needed, and ability to motivate those around them. In short, they see the student as a real asset to the foundation.\n\nThe student is enthusiastic about remaining involved and is happy to take on additional responsibilities or training if there are upcoming projects where an extra set of hands would be helpful. Please let me know if there are particular tasks or events you\u2019d like the student to support.\n\nThank you for your continued guidance and partnership.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
