  "email_content": "Hi Alex,\n\nI wanted to share some thoughts on your recent project.\n\n\u2022 Your data analysis is thorough and clearly demonstrates a solid grasp of the course concepts. The visualizations you chose make your findings easy to follow and help strengthen your overall argument.\n\n\u2022 To make the paper even sharper, consider tightening your hypothesis into a single, concise statement. A focused hypothesis will make it easier for the reader to see exactly what question you are answering and how your analysis supports that answer.\n\n\u2022 As you revise, you might also double-check that each section of the paper explicitly links back to that streamlined hypothesis. A brief sign-posting sentence at the start of key sections can guide the reader and underscore the logical flow of your argument.\n\n\u2022 Finally, a quick pass for wording and transitions will ensure the paper reads smoothly from start to finish.\n\nOverall, you have produced a strong piece of work \u2014 a few small refinements will make it even more compelling.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you\u2019d like to discuss further.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
