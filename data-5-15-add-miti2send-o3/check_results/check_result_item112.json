  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nBelow is a concise overview of the standard procedures we follow when assisting customers and reporting issues. I\u2019ve also included a couple of internal resources that should be useful.\n\nHandling customer inquiries\n1. Verify the customer\u2019s identity (photo ID + account verification questions).\n2. Listen to and clarify the request, taking notes in the CRM.\n3. If the request is routine (balance inquiry, statement print-out, etc.), process it immediately and confirm completion with the customer.\n4. For requests involving transactions, follow the step-by-step workflow in the Teller Operations Guide (see link below) and obtain the required approvals for amounts above the daily threshold.\n5. Document the interaction in the CRM before closing the session.\n\nIssue-reporting protocol\n1. Determine whether the issue is routine (e.g., minor system glitch) or critical (e.g., suspected fraud).\n2. Routine issues: open a ticket in the Service Desk portal and attach any screenshots or error codes.\n3. Critical issues: call the Help Desk, then email the ticket number and a brief description so they can fast-track it.\n4. Escalate anything that affects branch operations or customer security to your branch manager, who will coordinate further steps.\n\nKey resources\n\u2022 Teller Operations Guide \u2013 Section 2 covers everyday transactions; Section 4 details approval levels.\n\u2022 Service Desk Portal \u2013 use the \u201cBanking Systems\u201d queue for technical problems and the \u201cRisk/Fraud\u201d queue for security concerns.\n\u2022 Help Desk email: internal-help@trustwellbank.com (monitored 7 AM\u20137 PM).\n\u2022 Regional Managers Contact List \u2013 available in the intranet directory if you need branch-level escalation.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to walk through any scenario in more detail, and I\u2019ll be happy to set up a quick call.\n\nBest,\nJane",
