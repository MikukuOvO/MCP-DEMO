  "email_content": "Hi Emily,\n\nIt was nice meeting you recently! As promised, here are a few take-aways from my creative writing class that I thought you might enjoy:\n\n\u2022  Sensory layering \u2013 starting a scene by anchoring the reader in one strong sense (sound of rain, scent of coffee, etc.) and then weaving in two others tends to pull the audience in faster than a straight visual description.\n\n\u2022  \"Show, then tell\" \u2013 we practiced letting a subtle action or detail imply the emotion before naming it. For example, instead of writing \"She was nervous,\" having her trace the rim of her glass until fingerprints smudge says more with fewer words.\n\n\u2022  Dialogue compression \u2013 trimming small talk and slipping exposition into subtext keeps conversations lively. Our instructor had us remove one line from every exchange; almost nothing felt missing afterward.\n\n\u2022  Revision as excavation \u2013 on the second draft, we looked for the single paragraph that held the story\u2019s pulse and rewrote the rest of the piece around it. Painful but effective!\n\n\u2022  Creative constraints \u2013 giving ourselves limits (100-word micro-scene, all one-syllable words, etc.) sparked surprising solutions when we returned to regular prose.\n\nIf you ever want to trade drafts or brainstorm story ideas, let me know\u2014always happy to swap inspiration.\n\nHappy writing,\n[Your Name]",
