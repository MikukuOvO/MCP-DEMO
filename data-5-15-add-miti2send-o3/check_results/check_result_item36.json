  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nThanks for reaching out. I understand that rumors can be unsettling, so I wanted to share what I know.\n\n\u2022 There are no plans for a structural reorganization or workforce reductions. Recent initiatives\u2014such as the TeamBoost development workshops\u2014are strictly focused on enhancing collaboration and professional growth, not downsizing.\n\n\u2022 Leadership reiterated during the most recent all-hands meeting that our projects are on track and the company outlook remains positive.\n\n\u2022 Should any significant changes ever be considered, the management team has committed to communicating them openly and well in advance.\n\nI hope this helps put your mind at ease, but please let me know if there\u2019s anything else I can clarify.\n\nBest regards,\nJane",
