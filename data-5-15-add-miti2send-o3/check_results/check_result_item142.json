  "email_content": "Hi Michael,\n\nThank you for sharing the latest draft. I\u2019ve had a chance to read through it and wanted to pass along a few thoughts.\n\n\u2022 The character development has grown noticeably stronger since the last version. Your portrayal of the central relationships feels nuanced and authentic.\n\n\u2022 The pacing in the third act slows a bit and risks diffusing the story\u2019s tension. Tightening some of the transitional moments or trimming certain scenes might help maintain momentum as you move toward the climax.\n\nOverall, the voice and thematic layering are compelling. I\u2019m excited to see how the next revision evolves and am happy to chat further if that would be helpful.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
