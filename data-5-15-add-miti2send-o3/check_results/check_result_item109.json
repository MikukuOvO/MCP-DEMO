I\u2019ve reviewed our recent engagement data and spotted a few encouraging patterns that may guide UI improvements:\n\n\u2022 The refreshed onboarding tutorial coincided with a noticeable bump in user retention.\n\u2022 Average session duration continues to rise, indicating people are finding value and navigating more fluidly.\n\u2022 Visitors regularly gravitate toward the Account Settings and Security areas, so keeping these sections easy to locate and streamlined remains important.\n\nHappy to walk through the details and brainstorm next steps together\u2014just let me know a convenient time.\n\nBest,\nJane",
