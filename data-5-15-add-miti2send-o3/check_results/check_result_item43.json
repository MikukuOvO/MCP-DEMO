  "email_content": "Hi Lisa,\n\nWelcome aboard! Below is a compact snapshot of what tends to help Ethan feel comfortable and engaged. Feel free to keep this handy as you get to know him.\n\n1. Rhythm & Routine\n\u2022 Ethan thrives on clear, predictable sequences (wake-up, meals, activity blocks, wind-down). Giving him a heads-up before transitions \u2013 for example, \u201cIn a few minutes we\u2019ll switch to reading time\u201d \u2013 helps everything run smoothly.\n\n2. Food & Mealtimes\n\u2022 Prefers warm, familiar foods and crunchy fruit snacks.\n\u2022 Calm, low-noise settings let him focus on eating.\n\u2022 Having a small selection of preferred snacks nearby can turn a rough moment around quickly.\n\n3. Favorite Ways to Play & Learn\n\u2022 Animals, nature shows, and any chance to visit a petting area or zoo.\n\u2022 Water play (e.g., simple splash activities); he\u2019s enthusiastic about learning to swim.\n\u2022 Drawing, colouring, and other open-ended art projects \u2013 keeping art supplies in reach is a great ice-breaker.\n\u2022 Puzzle or problem-solving games offer a nice \u201cquiet focus\u201d option when he needs down-time.\n\n4. Communication & Support\n\u2022 He\u2019s practising asking for a break when things feel too busy or loud. A gentle prompt like \u201cWould you like a quiet moment?\u201d can make it easier for him to self-advocate.\n\u2022 Visual or verbal choices (\"Do you want music or puzzles next?\") help him feel in control and reduce anxiety.\n\n5. First-Day Tip\nOpening with an activity that features animals or art, followed by a familiar snack, usually sets a positive tone and builds quick rapport.\n\nThank you for being part of Ethan\u2019s support team. Let me know if any questions come up \u2013 I\u2019m happy to help.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
