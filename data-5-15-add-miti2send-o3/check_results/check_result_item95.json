  "email_content": "Dear CodeCrafters Team,\n\nThank you for reaching out regarding the upcoming software upgrade. We are eager to move forward and appreciate your support in making this transition smooth.\n\nCurrent environment (high-level):\n\u2022 Centralised database that runs on a legacy application layer handling all customer transactions and data storage.\n\u2022 Key goals for the upgrade are strengthened security controls, faster transaction processing, and easier future scalability.\n\u2022 Minimal service interruption is essential; continuity for core banking functions must be maintained during cut-over.\n\nInitial requirements & considerations:\n1. Security \u2013 alignment with the latest industry standards (data-at-rest encryption, enhanced access logging, regular patching workflow).\n2. Performance \u2013 at least a 30-40 % improvement in average transaction throughput and lower peak-time latency.\n3. Compatibility \u2013 smooth integration with our existing data schema and downstream reporting tools.\n4. Roll-back plan \u2013 a clearly documented contingency in case of unexpected issues during deployment.\n\nAvailability: I am free for a brief coordination call late this week or early next week. Please suggest a convenient window that works for your team.\n\nIf there is any pre-call information or documentation you would like us to prepare, just let me know.\n\nLooking forward to collaborating on this project.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\n",
