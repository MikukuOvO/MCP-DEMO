  "email_content": "Hi Emily,\n\nIt's wonderful to hear from you! Life at Sterling & Locke keeps me on my toes, but I really enjoy it.\n\nMost mornings start with a quick review of client portfolios to see what\u2019s changed and to set priorities for the day. After catching up with my team to talk through market developments, I usually spend a good chunk of time drafting or fine-tuning financial statements and other reports. Later in the day I meet with clients to walk them through their numbers and answer questions, and before heading out I plan the next day so nothing slips through the cracks. I like the mix of analysis and conversation\u2014it keeps things interesting and meaningful.\n\nA recent highlight: during one meeting we discovered a tax credit that will let a family-owned bakery hire its first apprentice. Seeing their excitement reminded me why I love this work\u2014the numbers we crunch can open real doors for people.\n\nHow are things on your end? Any new cultural discoveries or projects you\u2019re exploring? I\u2019d love to hear what you\u2019ve been reading, cooking, or thinking about lately.\n\nLooking forward to your reply!\n\nWarmly,\nJane",
