  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I\u2019m reaching out because I\u2019m putting together a community sports program designed to engage local youth in a range of athletic activities that promote teamwork, discipline, and healthy lifestyles. Given the Active Youth Foundation\u2019s outstanding track record of empowering young people through sport, I believe there\u2019s a natural synergy between our organizations.\n\nI\u2019ve drafted a brief proposal that outlines the program\u2019s goals, potential activities, and ways partners can contribute (coaching support, facilities access, joint fundraising, and community outreach). I\u2019d love to share this with you and hear your thoughts on how we might collaborate.\n\nWould you be available for a quick call or meeting next week to discuss possibilities? I\u2019m flexible and happy to work around your schedule.\n\nThank you for considering this. I\u2019m excited about the potential impact we could have together and look forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Organization]\n[Your Phone]",
