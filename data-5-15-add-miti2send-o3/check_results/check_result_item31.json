  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nThanks for reaching out \u2013 we\u2019re excited to partner with AdVantage Media on the upcoming campaign. Below is a concise snapshot of customer insights that should help us refine the messaging and channel mix.\n\n1. Segment highlights\n\u2022 18\u201334 (Millennial/Gen-Z): Roughly four out of five are active in our mobile app each week; top drivers are convenience and no-fee products. They respond well to short-form video and influencer content that showcases real-life money hacks.\n\u2022 35\u201354 (Gen-X/Early Millennials): This group is juggling mortgages, college savings, and everyday banking. Educational tools (rate calculators, refinancing guides) and transparent rate messaging lift engagement noticeably in our recent tests.\n\u2022 55 +: Security and personal service matter most. Retirement-focused content combined with simple, reassuring language generates the highest click-throughs. Direct-mail supported by follow-up email still outperforms pure digital for this cohort.\n\n2. Digital behavior trends\n\u2022 Mobile deposit usage is up significantly year over year; nearly seven in ten check deposits now occur in-app.\n\u2022 Digital wallet adoption has doubled over the past 12 months (now used by close to half of debit-card holders), driven mainly by the 18\u201334 segment.\n\u2022 About three-quarters of customers who have tried our budgeting tool log in at least weekly, suggesting strong appetite for financial-wellness messaging.\n\n3. Pain points & opportunities\n\u2022 Overdraft-fee anxiety: plain-language alerts and a short \u201cgrace period\u201d message strategy have cut negative sentiment in customer feedback.\n\u2022 Complex fee structures: customers favor bundles that combine checking and savings with a single flat monthly fee.\n\u2022 Support wait times: proactive in-app chat lowers escalation rates substantially.\n\n4. Recommended creative angles\n\u2022 \u201cZero-surprise banking\u201d theme for younger audiences \u2013 no hidden fees, instant alerts.\n\u2022 \u201cSmart home-ownership hub\u201d for 35-54 \u2013 calculators, webinars, checklists.\n\u2022 \u201cSecure tomorrow\u201d series for 55 + \u2013 retirement income planners, fraud-protection tips.\n\u2022 Use sequential storytelling: short explainer video \u2192 interactive tool \u2192 personalized offer.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like deeper dives or additional data points. I\u2019m happy to jump on a quick call to workshop concepts.\n\nBest,\nJohn\n",
