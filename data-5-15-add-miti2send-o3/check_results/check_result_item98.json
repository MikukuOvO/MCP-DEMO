  "email_content": "Hi Alex,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I wanted to share a brief update on how our patients are doing and how the Community Wellness Program is progressing:\n\n\u2022 Participation continues to grow. Over the past several weeks we\u2019ve seen a noticeable increase in patients making use of the resources provided by Helping Hands Foundation.\n\n\u2022 Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Patients report that the guidance, educational materials, and one-on-one check-ins have been especially helpful in their day-to-day recovery.\n\n\u2022 Support-group attendance is strong. Meetings have been consistently well attended, and participants are benefiting from the sense of community and peer encouragement.\n\n\u2022 Next steps. We are reviewing a few additional post-operative care resources shared by our broader network to see how they might complement the Foundation\u2019s offerings. I\u2019ll keep you posted on any that look like a good fit.\n\nThank you again for all that you and Helping Hands do. Please let me know if there\u2019s anything else you need from our side.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
