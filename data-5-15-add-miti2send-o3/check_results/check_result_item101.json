  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nHope you\u2019re doing well. Here are a few quick insights on how the Titans are gearing up for the championship:\n\n1. Intensified Training Block\n\u2022 Two-a-day sessions early in the week are devoted to endurance and weight work.\n\u2022 Later-week practices shift to full-speed tactical walk-throughs, emphasizing coordination and quick decision-making.\n\n2. Tactical Emphasis\n\u2022 Coaching staff is drilling rapid one-touch passing to keep possession and control tempo.\n\u2022 Expect the Titans to probe the right flank, an area they see as vulnerable in the opposing defense.\n\n3. Mindset & Personnel Notes\n\u2022 Team scrimmages are built around late-game scenarios to sharpen composure under pressure.\n\u2022 No significant injury worries; minutes are being managed so starters stay fresh.\n\n4. What to Watch on Game Day\n\u2022 An early high press to set the tone and wear down the opponent.\n\u2022 Rotating midfield pairings to maintain energy and exploit match-ups.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like any additional details or on-record quotes.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
