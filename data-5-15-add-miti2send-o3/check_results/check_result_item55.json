  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nThanks for reaching out about the SkyHigh Tower foundation design. I\u2019ve worked on similar high-rise projects and am happy to share some approaches that have proven helpful:\n\n\u2022 Establish an iterative soil\u2013structure interaction model early on so that axial, lateral and overturning demands are captured concurrently. A simple Winkler spring model is a good starting point, but you\u2019ll want to refine it with site-specific stiffness once geotech updates come in.\n\n\u2022 Map the full gravity and lateral load path from superstructure down to the mat/pile system. That helps spot any hidden discontinuities before you lock in member sizes.\n\n\u2022 Check service-level settlements first, then move to strength-level combinations. In previous towers we found that keeping total settlement under roughly 1/500 of the building height provided comfortable drift margins.\n\n\u2022 For load-bearing capacity, target a base safety factor of 3.0 for ultimate combinations and 2.0 for seismic. Adjust if local code allows but it\u2019s a solid baseline during concept design.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t forget the raft-edge shear punch checks around elevator and stair cores\u2014those critical zones often govern thickness.\n\nI\u2019ve pulled together a concise guideline that summarises the above points along with wind-induced overturning checks and load-distribution charts. Let me know if you\u2019d like me to share it or walk through any of the steps in more detail.\n\nHappy to jump on a quick call later this week if that would help.\n\nBest regards,\nJane",
