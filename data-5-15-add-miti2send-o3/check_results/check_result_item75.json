I wanted to share a short update on two individuals in our care who could benefit from Helping Hands' services:\n\n\u2022 An older adult who is recovering from recent surgery would appreciate assistance with transportation to and from her physical-therapy appointments.\n\n\u2022 Another individual is experiencing increased social isolation and would greatly benefit from regular companionship visits or phone check-ins.\n\nIf your team has availability to help, please let me know and I can share any additional details needed to coordinate the support.\n\nThank you for everything you and your team do.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
