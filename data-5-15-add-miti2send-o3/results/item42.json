Overall, my team and I appreciate its intuitive design and the noticeable efficiency gains we have experienced since adopting it.\\n\\nA few areas where additional functionality would make a significant difference for our clinical workflows:\\n\\n1. Flexible Repeat Patterns for Scheduling\\n   \u2022 In the medication and therapy scheduling modules, we often need custom repeat intervals (e.g., \\\"every X days\\\" or combinations of weekly schedules). Adding more granular options would help us manage complex treatment plans without manual work-arounds.\\n\\n2. Enhanced Care-Plan Editing\\n   \u2022 The ability to adjust existing schedules in bulk\u2014rather than cancelling and recreating them\u2014would streamline updates when a patient\u2019s treatment plan changes.\\n\\n3. Outcome & Utilization Analytics\\n   \u2022 We have already seen measurable improvements in patient outcomes since implementation. Built-in dashboards that track progress over time (and allow export to CSV) would strengthen our ability to evaluate and refine care plans.\\n\\nThank you again for your continued partnership and for considering these suggestions. Please let me know if you need any additional details.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[Your Name]\\n[Your Title / Clinic]\\n\"}"
