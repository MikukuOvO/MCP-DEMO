Innovation-Lab Hackathon (\u00bd Day)\\n   \u2022 Mixed, cross-functional teams tackle a real challenge pitched by leadership.\\n   \u2022 Quick demos and peer voting at the end \u2013 encourages creative problem-solving and knowledge-sharing.\\n\\n2. \u201cQuantum Quest\u201d Cooperative Challenge\\n   \u2022 A themed scavenger/escape-room style activity that hinges on communication and collective logic.\\n   \u2022 Works well indoors or across the retreat grounds.\\n\\n3. Outdoor Low-Ropes & Collaboration Stations\\n   \u2022 Short rotations through trust- and role-clarity challenges in nature.\\n   \u2022 Great for building resilience and respect in a relaxed setting.\\n\\n4. Storytelling Roundtable\\n   \u2022 Evening fireside-type session where colleagues share short stories about overcoming work hurdles.\\n   \u2022 Builds psychological safety and cross-team empathy.\\n\\n5. Wellness & Recharge Corners\\n   \u2022 Optional stretch/yoga or quiet zones between sessions so participants can recharge.\\n   \u2022 Helps maintain engagement throughout the retreat.\\n\\nPractical touches to consider:\\n\u2022 Deliberately mix departments within each group.\\n\u2022 Keep a couple of flex slots for spontaneous networking or reflection.\\n\u2022 Close with a quick \u201cinsights capture\u201d (video booth or digital board) so we can fold takeaways into post-retreat action items.\\n\\nLet me know which of these resonate or if you\u2019d like more detail \u2013 I\u2019m happy to help coordinate logistics or find facilitators.\\n\\nLooking forward to collaborating!\\n\\nBest,\\nJohn\"}"
