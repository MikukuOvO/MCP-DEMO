Specifically, I\u2019d like to see how the performance varies across the 25-34 and 35-44 age groups.\\\\n2. The ROI calculation looks promising, but I noticed that some of the engagement rates appear lower than anticipated. Is there a possibility that certain channels underperformed relative to expectations? If so, let\u2019s identify these to adjust the strategy for the upcoming campaigns.\\\\n3. Do the numbers presented include post-transaction retention metrics, such as repeat customer percentage or upsell conversion rates?\\\\n\\\\nLet me know if you\u2019re available for a call later this week to review these details together.
