Materials selected for construction include high-grade steel for the framework and reinforced glass for the facades, chosen for their durability and aesthetic appeal. Security checkpoint layouts are designed to minimize wait times while adhering to strict security protocols. The expansion also features biometric verification systems at all entry and exit points, and the deployment of intelligent AI monitoring throughout the terminal to enhance passenger safety. Confidential appendices provide an in-depth analysis of the cybersecurity measures implemented within the new systems to fortify Heathrow Terminal 5 against a broad spectrum of digital threats. These measures are meticulously designed to ensure robust security of the terminal's operational and passenger data.
