I\u2019m writing to share the key take-aways from our most recent round of research on passenger perceptions of public spaces (surveys and interviews completed this spring across several major airports).\\n\\nHighlights\\n1. Security Experience & Empathy\\n   \u2022 Passengers consistently pointed to security checkpoints as a major stress point.\\n   \u2022 Empathetic design cues\u2014clear way-finding, natural lighting, and courteous staff interactions\u2014significantly reduced reported anxiety levels.\\n\\n2. Privacy & Dignity\\n   \u2022 Respondents value processes that protect personal space and minimize unnecessary exposure of belongings.\\n   \u2022 Small, clearly marked \u201cquiet zones\u201d for secondary screening were rated highly for preserving dignity.\\n\\n3. Safety in Less-Monitored Areas\\n   \u2022 Participants expressed concern about seldom-patrolled transitional spaces (e.g., corridors adjoining restrooms or lounges).\\n   \u2022 Extending visible staff presence and incorporating passive security features (enhanced sightlines, subtle surveillance signage) improved perceived safety.\\n\\n4. Calming Environmental Elements\\n   \u2022 Soft seating clusters, greenery, and ambient soundscapes contributed to a more relaxed overall journey\u2014especially when these elements were distributed beyond the main concourse.\\n\\nRecommended Next Steps\\n\u2022 Prototype an \u201cempathy-first\u201d checkpoint layout and run a short pilot to measure stress indicators.\\n\u2022 Audit transitional zones for sightline interruptions and explore low-cost environmental improvements.\\n\u2022 Develop a set of design guidelines that integrate privacy, dignity, and calm across the passenger journey.\\n\\nI have the full dataset and supporting visuals ready and can forward them or schedule a briefing at your convenience.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you\u2019d like any additional detail or a meeting to walk through the findings.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[Your Name]\\nPassenger Experience Research Group\"}"
