Advisers focus on degree planning, while mentors discuss discipline-specific growth and career goals.\\n\\n\u2022 Tiered Tutoring & Peer-Mentoring \u2013 We run a centrally funded tutoring center for introductory courses and a peer-mentoring program in upper-division classes, allowing students to both receive help and develop leadership skills.\\n\\n\u2022 Skills Workshops \u2013 Short, skill-focused sessions (time-management, exam strategies, research methods, etc.) are offered throughout the semester. Attendance data show that students who participate in at least two workshops typically see measurable GPA gains in subsequent terms.\\n\\n\u2022 Scaffolded Assessment & Feedback \u2013 Faculty are encouraged to break major assessments into smaller milestones with formative feedback, helping students adjust study approaches early on.\\n\\n\u2022 Faculty Professional Development \u2013 We invest in training on inclusive pedagogy, universal design for learning, and evidence-based teaching practices so that classroom environments remain supportive and adaptive.\\n\\n\u2022 Cross-Functional Care Team \u2013 Advising, counseling, financial-aid, and residential-life staff meet weekly to coordinate outreach for students who may be juggling academic, financial, or personal challenges.\\n\\nThese elements work together to create a holistic support ecosystem rather than isolated fixes. If you\u2019d like more detail on any piece\u2014or data on the impact we\u2019ve observed\u2014let me know.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[Your Name]\"}"
